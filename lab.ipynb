She studied French horn and then composition at the San Jose State University, later receiving a composition PhD from the Eastman School of Music, where she studied with Samuel Adler and possibly Warren Benson. LeSiege taught composition for seven years at Wake Forest University, later teaching at New Jersey City University and the University of Maine. Her compositions number 70 published works, and often feature the French Horn.\\n\\nLife and career\\nAnnette LeSiege was born in 1947 in Oakland, California, US. Originally in the Wake Forest Magazine She was raised in Sunnyvale, California by her parents Armand and Mabel LeSiege; amid her father\\'s early death, her stepfather Raymond Phelps helped out. Although a bassoonist in her youth, LeSiege attended San Jose State University (SJSU) to study French horn, graduating in 1968. She stayed at SJSU for a Master of Arts, initially in music history; after studying composition with Higo Hugo Harada she switched to an MA in composition, graduating in 1970. After briefly studying at Cornell University for a PhD in composition, LeSiege switched to the doctorate program at the Eastman School of Music, where she studied with Samuel Adler and possibly Warren Benson, graduating in 1975. For her PhD thesis she wrote the orchestral work Montage and prepared an accompanying musical analysis.\\n\\nFrom 1975 to 1982 LeSiege taught composition at Wake Forest University (WFU) as a professor of music. She arrived at WFU was undergoing renovations in the music department; her colleague Edwin Wilson noted that \"She came here at an important transition time for the music department\". At some point LeSiege was chair of the music department also serving on the council of the College Music Society from 1979 to 1981. She received the Hinda Honingman Composer\\'s Cup in 1981. Among her students was the composer Clare Shore, who recalled her teacher\\'s encouragement in studying works of contemporary classical music, particularly Samuel Barber. LeSiege\\'s other students included composer Sarah Aderholdt. In 1977 LeSiege was a fellow at the MacDowell Colony in the Sprague-Smith studio, only a year old at the time.\\n\\nAfter her WFU period, LeSiege\\'s biography becomes less clear. At some point she was managing director of the Symphony for United Nations (now the UN Symphony) and a development officer for the Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula. By 1991 she worked at the Santa Catalina School in Monterey, California, as chair of the department of music. Eventually she became a professor of music at the New Jersey City University (NJCU) in Jersey City. An associate professor, she became NJCU\\'s assistant dean of the Music Department and after her retirement in 2009, a professor emerita.\\n\\nAmid a brain cancer diagnosis in 2009, LeSiege retired from full-time teaching and moved to Rockland, Maine. There she taught composition and liberal arts topics part-time at the University of Maine in Augusta. She died in Marina, California, US on August 26, 2012. In an obituary, the former-student and singer Adria Firestone described her as a \"gadfly with feet-on-the-ground playfulness and discipline infused with passion\" Soprano Teresa Radomski, a fellow Eastman student, emphasized the beauty and skilled prosody of LeSiege\\'s music, describing her as \"a wonderful teacher, warm, compassionate and kind\".\\n\\nMusic\\n\\nLeSiege\\'s body of work includes 70 published compositions, many of them commissions. The vast majority of them were published by SeeSaw Publishing (since sold to the Subito Music Corporation), of which she may have owned a small part. Her personal mood and the source material would determine her approach to individual compositions and she described music as \"controlling the existing energy into sound\". Horn player Katey J. Halbert notes that \"she did not try to fit one style or technique, but was always experimenting with new processess\". Many of LeSiege\\'s works feature the French horn.\\n\\nList of compositions\\nSee  and  for more\\n\\n Sapphire Seesaw, orchestra \\n Bautade, orchestra \\n Shadow Dancer (1994), unaccompanied horn in F\\n\\nReferences\\nCitations\\n\\nSources\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nExternal links\\n Works by LeSiege on Theodore Front Musical Literature\\n\\nCategory:1947 births\\nCategory:2012 deaths\\nCategory:Eastman School of Music alumni\\nCategory:Musicians from Oakland, California\\nCategory:Wake Forest University faculty\\nCategory:20th-century classical composers\\nCategory:21st-century classical composers\\nCategory:American women classical composers\\nCategory:20th-century American composers\\nCategory:20th-century American women composers\\nCategory:San Jose State University alumni',\n"," 'Per Henrik Pontus Leijon (born 27 October 1978) is a Swedish professional golfer and former Challenge Tour player. \\n\\nCareer\\nLeijon was a promising junior golfer and represented Örkelljunga Golf Club.

This \"exogenous primary branching\" differentiates the genus from other members of the Delesseriaceae, other than the closely related genus Taenioma. \\n\\nSpecies of Caloglossa are red to brown in color. Each thalli has a conspicuous midrib which is formed by a row of elongated cells. In fresh water, populations spread vegetatively. In brackish water, the plants may reproduce sexually.\\n\\nDistribution\\nCaloglossa is a common genus worldwide, and is distributed  in littoral zones from tropical to temperate waters. They can grow in habitats of varying salinity, and may be found growing on stones on marine coasts, in brackish estuaries, epiphytically in saltmarsh and mangrove habitat, and in total freshwater areas.\\n\\nUse\\nThe genus sees use in aquascaping and may be found in the aquarium trade. One species in particular, Caloglossa cf. beccarii, is popular as it exhibits a variety of colors and is easy to cultivate.\\n\\nCaloglossa beccarii has also been investigated as a potential food item in Thailand. It was found to have insignificant toxicity while providing a potentially rich nutritional benefit.\\n\\nTaxonomy\\nSome authors have considered the taxon authority to be Jacob Georg Agardh instead of Georg Matthias von Martens. King & Puttock (1994) argued that Martens did not formally elevate Caloglossa to genus rank in his 1869 publication, preferring to follow Agardh\\'s 1876 treatment instead. The diversity of species within Caloglossa has been heavily studied and subject to much revision.

The holotype, a skull table, was part of the hypodigm for \"Caiman lutescens\", which was later found to be a nomen dubium. Since a lectotype had been erected for \"C. lutescens\", the skull table was not name-bearing and was thus used to erect Paranacaiman. The genus is monotypic, meaning it only contains a single species: Paranacaiman bravardi.\\n\\nHistory and naming\\nthumb|left|MACN PV 13551 is a well preserved skull table initually used in the hypodigm of Caiman lutescens and would later become the holotype of Paranacaiman.\\nThe type specimen of Paranacaiman is the isolated skull table designated MACN-Pv 13551, which has historically been tied to the now dubious taxon \"Caiman lutescens\". \"Caiman lutescens\" was described in 1912 by Italian paleontologist Gaetano Rovereto as \"Alligator lutescens\" on the basis of various fragmentary skull and postcranial remains found within the layers of the Ituzaingó Formation in Argentina. However, Rovereto did not designate a holotype specimen among his finds, rendering the entire collection of bones including the skull table MACN-Pv 13551 the syntype of his species. In 1933 an attempt was made to bring better stability to the taxon, with a partial snout being elected to become the lectotype of the taxon. Subsequently, the validity of the taxon rested on this specimen being diagnostic while the remaining fossils of the syntype were no longer fundamental to the deffinition of the species. \"Alligator lutescens\" eventually came to be considered a species of the genus Caiman by Wann Langston, with some authors even declaring it a synonym of Caiman latirostris.\\n\\nin 2012, Paula Bona and colleagues argued that the lectotype was indeed referrable to Caiman latirostris, but argued for the validity of \"Caiman lutescens\" by erroneously considering the diagnostic skull table the holotype. Bona would return to the matter in 2024 with another publication, ammending the mistake of considering the skull table the holotype. They reinforce the notion that the \"Caiman lutescens\" was a nomen dubium, although rather than assigning the lectotype to Caiman latirostris they highlight that the lack of diagnostic features means it cannot be identified to anything more specific than Jacarea. Since the diagnostic and distinct skull table was no longer tied to any specific name, the genus and species Paranacaiman bravardi was coined for it. In addition to the holotype, another skull table and two isolated frontals were also assinged to the taxon. There\\'s the possibility of a third skull table belonging to Paranacaiman, but said specimen belonged to a juvenile that cannot be confidently assigned to the genus.\\n\\nThe name Paranacaiman means \"Caiman from Paraná\" in reference to the banks of the Paraná River where the fossil material was discovered. The species name meanwhile honors Auguste Bravard, a French geologist and paleontologist who was the first to study the Cenozoic fossils of the region.\\n\\nDescription\\nParanacaiman is only known from very limited skull material, chiefly a largely complete skull table and the still attached prefrontal bones. The prefrontals possess rounded edges, both those facing outwards as well as the medial margins, which sets them apart from any modern caiman species. The paired elements slightly contact each other along the midline and connect with the frontal bone, with which they form a prominent V-shaped shelf not seen in other large contemporary caimans like Paranasuchus. Typically in modern caimans the frontal has a long anterior process that often extends forward beyond the beginning of the eyesockets, however, in Paranacaiman the anterior process is very short, only beginning behind the orbital margins.\\n\\nthumb|Though no precise estimates are given, Paranacaiman is described as a \"huge\" animal.\\nThe skull table of Paranacaiman is noted for the fact that the edge at the back of the skull  is concave to a point that it\\'s almost V-shaped. This already distinguishes it from most crown caimans with the exception of some individuals of Acresuchus as well as some black caimans. The rims of the eyesockets are well developed and raised, creating a prominent groove that stretches across the skull table. Paranacaiman lacks the well-developed squamosal \"horns\" most prominently seen in Acresuchus but also present in Purussaurus and Mourasuchus. As with most crocodilians, two openings can be seen piercing the skull table, the supratemporal fenestra, though while they tend to be round to sub-circular in most modern caimans, they are very narrow and small in Paranacaiman.\\n\\nBroadly speaking, the upper surface of the skull table is formed by five bones: the frontal bone that extends between the eyes and connects to the prefrontals, two postorbital bones on either side forming the anterior corners of the element, the paired squamosals that project backwards and form the posterior corner, giving the skull table its V-shaped indentation, the singular parietal bone which in the case of Paranacaiman is entirely enclosed and the supraoccipital bone that forms the central part of the hind-most edge of the element. The squamosal bones that form the edges of the skull table are unassuming and do not form prominent swollen crests as seen in Acresuchus, Purussaurus and Mourasuchus. The supraoccipital is a prominent element of the skull table, well exposed and responsible for the parietal bone not contributing to the edges of the skull table. Notably, its deeply concave and depressed relative to the surrounding squamosals and parietal, which forms a continuation of the groove that stretches across the skull table. While a concave skull table is seen in some modern caimans, this effect is usually achieved by the fact that the squamosal bones are inclined, while this is not the case in Paranacaiman.\\n\\nSize\\nParanacaiman is described as \"huge\" by Bona and colleagues, but the type description offers no precise size estimates.\\n\\nPhylogeny\\nPhylogenetic analysis has recovered Paranacaiman as forming a clade with the contemporary Paranasuchus as well as several large-bodied Miocene caimans, namely Mourasuchus, Purussaurus and Acresuchus. Within this clade, the two Parana species form a trichotomy with Mourasuchus, while Purussaurus and Acresuchus were recovered as each others closest relatives. Overall, this group seems to be the sister clade to Jacarea, the group that includes the modern genera Caiman and Melanosuchus as well as their closest extinct relatives.\\n\\nThe recovery of Paranacaiman as a close relative to Mourasuchus and Paranasuchus supports the results previously recovered by Rio and Mannion in 2021. In their study, they scored Caiman lutescens based on the holotype of Paranacaiman and found it to clade with Caiman gasparinae and Mourasuchus much like Bona and colleagues would in 2024. However, the two studies differ in that Bona and colleagues found them to clade with Purussaurus and Acresuchus, whereas Rio and Mannion placed the latter within Jacarea while the former were merely the sister group to crown caimans.\\n\\nPaleobiology\\nParanacaiman is exclusively known from the Late Miocene Ituzaingó Formation of Paraná, Argentina. Like other Miocene localities of South America, the Ituzaingó Formation preserves a high diversity of crocodilians, including the gulp-feeding Mourasuchus, the narrow-snouted gharial Gryposuchus and the large macropredator Purussaurus, although the presence of Purussaurus has been called into question by Bona and colleagues. A key difference between the Ituzaingó and more northern localities like those of the Urumaco and Solimões Formations concerns both the absence of durophageous caimans (hard-shelled prey specialists) and the abundance of generalists. The latter are represented not only by Paranacaiman but also by Paranasuchus and Caiman australis.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nCategory:Alligatoridae\\nCategory:Miocene crocodylomorphs\\nCategory:Miocene reptiles of South America\\nCategory:Neogene Argentina\\nCategory:Fossils of Argentina\\nCategory:Fossil taxa described in 2024',\n"," \"Corruption in Honduras is a serious problem, affecting various aspects of governance and the Honduran society. Out of the 180 nations listed in the Transparency International’s 2023 corruption Index, it ranked 154th making it one of the lowest performing countries in the Latin American region. It only ranked better than Nicaragua, Haiti, and Venezuela.Honduras: Strong action needed on corruption. Human Rights Watch. https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/06/09/honduras-strong-action-needed-corruption Corruption is one of the factors, along with drug-related crimes and poverty, that reinforce and perpetuate the fragility of the rule of law in the country.The Borgen Project. Fragility of the rule of law in Honduras. The Borgen Project\\n\\nBackground\\nIn Honduras corruption has deep historical roots and is, thus, entrenched in society. It is no longer characterized by the iniquitous doings of individual perpetrators. Throughout the years, operating system of kleptocratic networks emerged, dominating the country’s political, social, and economic spheres. These networks have assumed cross-sectoral and transnational forms. Corruption today is committed not only for individual gain but at a scale that resembles a bureaucracy, benefitting a large swathe of members.Chayes, Sarah. (2017) When Corruption is the Operating System: The Case of Honduras. Carnegie Endowment International for Peace. https://carnegie-production-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/static/files/Brief-Chayes_Honduras.pdf.\\n\\nOne of the most serious types of corruption in Honduras involves the misappropriation of funds meant for the delivery of essential public services. Public funds lost to corruption in 2018 amounted to more than $2 billion, constituting 12.5% of the Honduran GDP. Examples of notable cases include the $300-million embezzlement case in the public health care system. The National Anti-Corruption Council found that from 2014 to 2016, a civil society organization diverted $300 million from the public health system to private businesses. The fund was then used to finance political campaigns such as Hernandez’ 2013 presidential campaign.Congressional Research Service. Corruption in Honduras: End of the Mission to Support the Fight Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras. Congressional Research Service. https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN11211.\\n\\nIn 2019, 176 politicians and a string of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) were also prosecuted for embezzlement. It involved a corrupt network of nonprofits that obtained more than $70 million from the public coffers over the past decade. Again, several of these organizations funneled the funds to politicians and to campaigns that were launched to influence the outcome of Honduran elections.Ernst, Jeff. (2010). Exclusive: A Pandora’s Box of Corruption in Honduras. Pulitzer Center. https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/exclusive-pandoras-box-corruption-honduras.\\n\\nBy October 2023, prosecutors indicted two former conservative presidents for diverting $12 million of public funds to bankroll their political campaigns. These were Juan Orlando Hernandez and his predecessor Porfirio Lobo. The former was also extradited to the United States in 2022 due to drug trafficking charges.Palencia, Gustavo. (2023). Honduras prosecutors accuse two ex-presidents of diverting public funds to campaigns. Reuters. https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/honduras-prosecutors-accuse-two-ex-presidents-diverting-public-funds-campaigns-2023-10-11/ Like the earlier case of embezzlement scandal, this case also involved a network of corruption, which was constituted by organizations formed between 2010 and 2013. Lobo's wife, the former first lady Rosa Elena Bonilla, was convicted in 2019 for embezzling around $600,000 during the course of her husband's term. The corruption charges against her were initially lodged by the Organization of American States’ anti-corruption mission.Associated Press. (2019). Honduras’ ex-first lady convicted of fraud, embezzlement. AP. https://apnews.com/general-news-22fb081d3c704daca43fe8b25a8af566\\n\\nNarco state\\nThe growth in power and influence of criminal organizations, particularly, drug traffickers, contribute to the persistence of systemic corruption in Honduras. The country is part of the primary transit route of drugs from South America bound for sale in the U.S. market. It is already described as a critical narco-state since almost all the important institutions of governance work in favor of the drug trade. As a severely compromised state, this corruption tied to drugs exists not only at the highest levels of the police, judicial system, and national government but also in civil society, which is either co-opted or cowed by the influence of the drug cartels.Kan, Paul Rexton (2016-07-18). Drug Trafficking and International Security. Rowman & Littlefield. ISBN 978-1-4422-4759-8. p. 53  The situation became critical in the 2000s as Mexico started cracking down on its drug cartels. Drug traffickers in search of an alternative overland route found in Honduras a weak and pliant government.\\n\\nBy 2012, the U.S. Department of State reported that “more than 80 percent of the primary flow of the cocaine trafficked to the United States first transited through the Central American corridor” and that 87 percent of cocaine smuggling flights that depart in South America first land in Honduras.Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. (2024). Country Reports – Honduras through Mexico. U.S. Department of State. https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/inl/rls/nrcrpt/2013/vol1/204050.htm Around this period, it is estimated that the total value of the drug trade is equivalent to 13 percent of the Honduran GDP or 2/3 of the total budget allocated by the government for crime prevention.IMF.  (2016). Honduras: Selected Issues and Analytical Notes. International Monetary Fund. ISBN 978-1-4755-5655-1. p. 14\\n\\nThe most prominent bribery involved Juan Antonio Hernandez, who was convicted in the U.S. for drug trafficking in October 2019. He was the brother of President Hernandez and was a previous member of the Honduran legislature. It was revealed that he received bribes from Mexican, Colombian, and Honduran drug cartels.\\n\\nImpact\\nA UN-backed international commission on human rights and legal reforms found that corruption in Honduras undermines human rights. This is demonstrated in a study by the Human Rights Watch evaluating the judicial files of corruption investigations. It found that corruption is linked to human rights abuses. The systemic corruption in the country has led to the inability of the government to fund and support public health, education, clean water, housing, and other rights.\\n\\nCorruption also has an adverse impact on the private sector as it results in an increase of the cost of investment due to red tape and increased uncertainty on the part of private firms. In addition, the misappropriation of funds not only reduces the efficiency of government spending but it also increases public mistrust of its revenue collection, which leads to tax evasion.\\n\\nAnti-corruption efforts\\nThere is a view that anti-corruption reform in Honduras has very little chance of success since corrupt interests are scaled across all levels of authority. This means that any initiative launched to root out corruption is bound to hit a wall of resistance.Rotberg, Robert I. (2018-10-19). Corruption in Latin America: How Politicians and Corporations Steal from Citizens. Springer. ISBN 978-3-319-94057-1. p. 283 There are, however, several public and private attempts to address the Honduran culture of corruption. An example is the Justice, Human Rights, and Security Strengthening Activity (Unidos por la Justicia), which is a USAID-funded program established to facilitate institutional reform, access to justice and civil society, increase policing, and women empowerment, among others.\\n\\nPresident Xiomara Castro also created the International Commission against Corruption and Impunity (Comision Internacional contra la Corrupcion e Impunidad en Honduras). This commission, which was established through a memorandum with the United Nations, aimed to learn from past experiences and make lasting progress in addressing corruption in the country. The creation of the commission is a significant development in solving the corruption problem because it had investigative powers. Two of the high-profile cases it handled were the murder of the environmental and human rights activist, Bertha Caceres, and the 2009 assassination of Aristides Gonzales, the Honduran anti-drug czar. In 2020, however, Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez allowed the mandate of this commission to expire, setting back its capability to help institutions deter and investigate high-level corruption.\\n\\nHonduras also instituted police reform. Key components of this initiative include training and education of the police. The average salary of the uniformed personnel was also increased. These reforms complemented a depuration process, which aimed to weed out corrupt officers. In 2016, a total of 100 police officers were terminated and this number included 2 police directors and 27 commissioners.\\n\\nLegal barriers\\nThere are also legal barriers that prevent Honduras from addressing corruption. This is demonstrated in the case of the new penal code passed in June 2020. The new law reduced punishments for corruption and drug trafficking-related crimes. Those who are convicted of corruption-related crimes can also have their sentences reduced if they repay their stolen funds. Fourteen government officials convicted of graft were acquitted because of the new code.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nCorruption\\nCorruption\\nCorruption\\nCorruption\\nCorruption\\nCorruption\",\n"," 'Climatological normals of India are long-term averages of meteorological variables that provide a standard baseline for assessing India\\'s climate and its variations.

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) defines climatological normals as \"arithmetic averages of climatological data computed for consecutive periods of thirty years\". These normals are crucial for understanding India\\'s diverse climate patterns and serve multiple purposes:\\n\\n Baseline for climate assessment: They provide a reference point for comparing current weather conditions to long-term averages.\\n Climate change monitoring: Normals help in identifying long-term climate trends and assessing the impacts of climate change across India\\'s varied geography.\\n Sectoral planning: They are essential for various sectors such as agriculture, water resource management, urban planning, and energy production.\\n Weather forecasting: Normals assist meteorologists in making more accurate weather predictions by providing historical context.\\n\\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) calculates these normals for numerous weather parameters, including temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed. The normals are updated every decade to reflect the most recent 30-year period, ensuring they remain relevant in the face of changing climate conditions.\\n\\n Historical Development of the Normals \\nThe concept of climatological normals in India has a rich history dating back to the early days of organized meteorological observations:\\n\\n Early beginnings: The India Meteorological Department was established in 1875, marking the start of systematic weather observations across the country.\\n First publication: The first set of climatological tables for India was published in 1904, based on data from 171 stations.\\n Standardization: In 1935, the International Meteorological Organization (now WMO) standardized the use of 30-year periods for calculating normals, starting with 1901–1930.\\n Expansion of network: Over the decades, IMD significantly expanded its network of weather stations, improving the spatial coverage and accuracy of climatological data.\\n Modernization: The introduction of automated weather stations and advanced data processing techniques in the late 20th century enhanced the quality and quantity of data used for calculating normals.\\n Recent updates: IMD has consistently updated its climatological normals every decade. The most recent set covers the period from 1991 to 2020, replacing the previous 1981-2010 normals.\\n Increased parameters: Over time, the range of meteorological parameters included in the normals has expanded, providing a more comprehensive view of India\\'s climate.\\n\\n List of Observatories \\nThere are a total of 405 observatories spread across Indian cities and villages from where this data has been collected. Out of this total of 405, 16 are in 12 big cities, 50 in rural areas and remaining (339) are in small and mid-sized cities.\\n+StateStationPopulationCity/Town/VillageAndaman and Nicobar IslandsCar

He was known for his “tent life” videos documenting his experiences living in a camp for displaced Palestinians during the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip. He was killed on August 26, 2024, after he was hit by a shrapnel during an Israeli airstrike on Gaza\\'s southern city of Khan Younis.\\n\\n Early life and education \\nHalimy was born and raised in Gaza City, Palestine. He was the son of Adi Al-Halimy. He had four brothers and a sister. Halimy was an alumnus United States Department of State’s Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study (YES) program which allows students from predominantly Muslim countries to live and study in the United States for an academic year. He was a student at Harker Heights High School in Harker Heights, Texas from 2021 to 2022. In the summer of 2023, Halimy worked in the Gaza-Based Spark charity. Prior to October 7th 2023, Halimy was a student at Gaza\\'s Al-Azhar University, studying political science and economics. On October 7th, 2023, Halimy’s family was displaced from their home in Gaza city following the Hamas attack on Israel and the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war. Throughout the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, his family was displaced multiple times moving between Khan Younis and Rafah. In late April 2024, they were sent back to Khan Younis following the invasion of Rafah. During this time, his grandmother has died due to medicine shortages from the ongoing blockade of the Gaza Strip.\\n\\n Online presence \\nHalimy launched his TikTok account after fleeing with his family to Muwasi, the southern coastal area of Gaza that Israel had designated a humanitarian safe zone. He gained a substantial following on Instagram and Tiktok in the summer of 2024 through his vlogs that documented his daily life in Gaza in a camp for internally-displaced Palestinians. He showcased his “tent life” which included sharing moments of joy during deadly conditions and limited internet access, as well as, how he did chores, secured food and managed boredom. Halimy stated these vlogs were to show the resilience, strength, and survival of the Palestinian people. In addition to these daily vlogs, he also had a gardening series where he would plant seeds outside his tent to represent life. Along with his collaborator Talal Murad, they created a joint Instagram page called Gazan Experience where they would answer user questions about how Gazans were living under the current conditions. Halimy was widely praised by viewers for finding small moments of joy amid the destruction around him.\\n\\n Death \\nOn August 26, 2024, Halimy was hit by a shrapnel during an Israeli airstrike on Gaza\\'s southern city of Khan Younis. The fatal strike happened in a nearby street to Halimy and his collaborator Murad who were both hit by the deadly debris of the strike.

He was the club's most successful captain, winning the Copa del Generalísimo in 1964 and 1966, and the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1964.\\n\\nEarly life\\nBorn to a well-off family in San Sebastián in the Basque Country, Yarza excelled academically, in 1948 he joined the Faculty of Chemical Sciences at the University of Zaragoza. During this time, he played as a left winger and took penalty kicks for a university team touring the local area.\\n\\nYarza's performances for the university team earned him attention from clubs, and he signed for regional first division side Celta de Zaragoza, whom he helped to promotion to the Tercera División. During this time, he was conscripted for compulsory military service in Tarragona, which was spread out due to his university course; he rose to the rank of reserve second lieutenant.\\n\\n then signed Yarza, who moved on to Arenas de Zaragoza in a deal that would see Celta de Zaragoza have access to the latter club's facilities. Arenas de Zaragoza had connections with professional club Real Valladolid, but Yarza had instead committed to Real Zaragoza despite only being offered half as much salary there.\\n\\nCareer\\nYarza arrived at a Real Zaragoza side in the Segunda División, and made his debut on 13 September 1953 as the season began with a 3–2 loss away to Baracaldo. On 3 October 1954, he scored an own goal and made several errors in a 4–2 home loss to Cultural Leonesa on the fourth matchday, leading to criticism from journalists who highlighted his comparatively short height for a goalkeeper of 1.73 m. He asked manager Edmundo Suárez for a break and was subsequently replaced by , known as Lasheras.\\n\\nYarza did not recover a place in the team until 1959–60, with the team now in La Liga. The return of Suárez to the bench and frustration around Lasheras's failed negotiations with Real Madrid gave an opportunity to the 29-year-old. He captained the team in the Copa del Generalísimo final on 23 June 1963, a 3–1 loss to Barcelona at the Camp Nou. \\n\\nReal Zaragoza won their first trophy on 24 June 1964, lifting the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup with a 2–1 final win over compatriots Valencia. This was followed on 5 July with the Copa del Generalísimo, after defeating Atlético Madrid 2–1 in the final. With another domestic cup win two years later against Atlético Bilbao, he was the club's most successful captain of all time. In September 1966, the team lost the Fairs Cup final to Barcelona; having won 1–0 away in the first leg, Real Zaragoza fell 4–2 after extra time at La Romareda in the second leg, with Lluís Pujol scoring a hat-trick against Yarza. The Real Zaragoza side of this decade were known as Los Magníficos.\\n\\nLimited by an Achilles tendon rupture in his later career, Yarza played his final match aged 39 on 18 September 1968, a 3–1 loss away to Trakia Plovdiv of Bulgaria in the first round of the Fairs Cup, and was criticised by the press for his performance. Having played under four presidents and 16 managers, he was given a testimonial match on 1 May 1969 against Wiener Sport-Club of Austria.\\n\\nYarza was never called up by the Spain national football team, in an era when José Ángel Iribar was the dominant goalkeeper. He was called up to the B-team in 1960, but was not capped.\\n\\nLater life and death\\nYarza returned to his hometown after football, and ran a bar with Zaragoza teammate . He died of liver cancer on 1 August 2001, aged 70.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n\\nCategory:1930 births\\nCategory:2001 deaths\\nCategory:Footballers from San Sebastián\\nCategory:Spanish men's footballers\\nCategory:Men's association football goalkeepers\\nCategory:University of Zaragoza alumni\\nCategory:Real Zaragoza players\\nCategory:La Liga players\\nCategory:Segunda División players\\nCategory:Tercera División players\\nCategory:Deaths from liver cancer in Spain\",\n"," 'thumb|300px|right|Royal Palace of Tordesillas (right next to the church and the bridge) on a panoramic view by Anton van den Wyngaerde (around 1565) \\n\\nThe Palace of Tordesillas () is a former royal residence in Tordesillas, Spain.

It had three gates: the main one, to the south facing the river; another to the west, on San Antolín Street and the third to the north, in front of the Alderete palace. It also had an exterior corridor that ran along the south façade and more than half of the west façade, continuing as an elevated passageway over the street to communicate with the church of San Antolín.\\n\\nIn the center of the south façade there was a square tower with three levels and a corridor in the last one, which was used for surveillance. The rooms were covered with wooden coffered ceilings and their walls with rich tapestries.

Until 1524, she was accompanied by her daughter, Catherine, who left Tordesillas when she married John III of Portugal.\\n\\nDue to the poor quality of the construction materials, it needed continuous repairs. After the death of Queen Joanna, the building was abandoned and, despite carrying out repairs to prevent its state of ruin, it was demolished in 1773 during the reign of Charles III. New buildings were constructed on the palace site and the urban landscape changed completely.\\n\\nFor an exhibition on the palace in Tordesillas in 2017, a replica of the palace has been made at a scale of 1:40.

The family is extensive and complex, encompassing multiple branches and houses, and has strong connections to the Amachree (pronounced Āmá-kiri) Royal family of the Kalabari Kingdom. Historical accounts suggest that Amachree (I), originally migrated from Amakalakala in Ogbia, another Ijaw sub-group.\\n\\nPrimarily of Ijaw ethnicity, the Briggs family belongs to the Kalabari Ijaw subgroup in Rivers State. The family\\'s prominence rose significantly through the Oruwari-Briggs House, previously led by the late High Chief Olu Benson Lulu-Briggs, popularly known as O.B. Lulu-Briggs.\\n\\nIn 2012, Forbes estimated High Chief O.B. Lulu-Briggs\\' net worth at approximately $500 million, solidifying the Lulu-Briggs family as one of the most renowned and affluent in the Niger Delta region. High Chief O.B. Lulu-Briggs was among the few Ijaws who secured Oil Mining Licenses (OML) early on and retained them. Instead of selling his license, he transformed it into Moni Pulo Petroleum Development Company (MPPDC), now Moni Pulo Limited (MPL), an oil exploration and production company that employs hundreds of youths and generates significant wealth daily. This strategic decision played a pivotal role in establishing the family\\'s long-lasting economic influence in the region.\\n\\n Historical Background \\n\\nThe Oruwari House traces its origins to the Dueinala lineage in the Akialame ward. After Dueinala\\'s era, leadership of the ward passed to Asukein, who lacked the resources to rebuild it. He was succeeded by Ikata, a renowned merchant, who also faced challenges in reuniting the dispersed lineage. The turning point came with Oruwari Biriki, later known as Oruwari-Briggs, who successfully rebuilt Dueinala\\'s ward, which later became known as Dueinala\\'s house. Oruwari\\'s father, Inoma, and his mother, Iniibatangamuari, were both from the Dueinala lineage. His name, Oruwariyibo, reflects these circumstances, meaning \"child born in a shrine.\"\\n\\nOruwari later returned to Elem Kalabari, where he adopted his grandfather\\'s trade name, Black Jimmy.\\n\\nLike other Ijaw sub-groups, the Kalabari participated in the 19th-century slave trade, acquiring slaves primarily to showcase wealth and expand their workforce. These slaves were eventually freed, with many being adopted into various families within the Kalabari Kingdom.\\n\\nThe Kalabari Civil War and its Aftermath\\n\\nThe socio-political tensions between the Amachree and Bob-Manuel alliances on one side, and the Awo-Barboy and Oruwari-Briggs alliances on the other, eventually weakened the state, pushing Princewill Amachree to seek British support. This culminated in the Treaty of Protection between Britain and Kalabari in 1883, which was signed by King Princewill Amachree IV and other leaders, including Chiefs Young-Briggs, George Amachree, Bob Manuel, John Bull, and Omekwe Horsefall Manuel.\\n\\nThe Kalabari Civil War provided an opportunity for previously conquered communities to regain their independence. The war, combined with the migration of populations from Elem Kalabari and the founding of new towns like Bakana, Buguma, Krakrama and Abonnema, marked the decline of the Kalabari Empire and its transformation into a republic or confederacy. \\nThe conflict led to the dispersion of the population, with people settling in new areas based on strategic alliances rather than biological or familial ties. This period marked the beginning of significant changes in the political and social structure of the Kalabari Kingdom, ultimately reshaping the region\\'s history.\\n\\n Activities \\nThe modern-day Briggs family is actively engaged in a broad range of activities, including philanthropy, business, and human capital development. Their influence extends far beyond Rivers State, with family members residing in various cities worldwide, contributing significantly across different sectors.\\n\\nPhilanthropy and Activism\\n\\nChief Dumo Lulu-Briggs, the son of the late High Chief Olu Benson Lulu-Briggs, is a significant figure within the family. He serves as the chairman and CEO of DLB Group, a conglomerate with diverse interests in the oil, gas, and marine industries. In addition, he is the chairman of Platform Petroleum Limited, an oil exploration and prospecting company. His leadership roles extend to his former positions as chairman of the governing council at the Maritime Academy of Nigeria, Oron, and as chairman of the board of management at the Federal Medical Centre, Owerri.\\nHis father, High Chief O.B. Lulu-Briggs, founded Moni Pulo Petroleum Development Company (MPPDC) in 1992, an oil exploration firm. Additionally, he was involved in Krakrama Investment Limited alongside Solate Lulu-Briggs, his daughter, and Lubrick Construction Company Limited.\\n\\nHigh Chief O.B. Lulu-Briggs was also a revered elder statesman, politician, trade unionist, businessman, and philanthropist who established the O.B. Lulu-Briggs Foundation, which continues to make significant contributions to the welfare of the less privileged.\\n\\nAnn-Kio Briggs, another notable family member, is an environmentalist and human rights activist. She founded the non-governmental organization Agape Birthrights and has served as the spokesperson for the Ijaw Republican Assembly (IRA) and the United Niger Delta Energy Development Security Strategy (UNDEDSS) as of 2011. Her advocacy work has made her a significant voice in environmental justice and the rights of the Ijaw people.\\n\\nBusiness and Leadership\\n\\nHon. Victor Tubotamuno Abiye Briggs is a significant figure within the Briggs family, recognized for his leadership as the CEO of Vic-Briggs Nigeria Limited and his influential role as a political stakeholder in Abonnema City, located in the Akuku-Toru Local Government Area of Rivers State. His contributions highlight the family\\'s continued impact in both business and politics within the region.\\n\\nAdditionally, the late Professor Nimi Briggs made significant contributions to the educational sector as a professor emeritus at the University of Port Harcourt. He also served as the second Pro-Chancellor of the Federal University Lokoja and chairman of the university\\'s governing council, leaving a lasting impact on Nigerian higher education.\\n\\nAnother notable member of the Briggs family is Dr Ine Briggs. As of 2024, Dr. Briggs serves as the Acting Director General of the Rivers State Bureau on Public Procurement. She is a distinguished certified engineer with the Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN) and a seasoned Project Management Professional (PMP). With over 24 years of experience, Dr. Ine Briggs brings a wealth of expertise and knowledge to her role.\\n\\nChief Dumo Lulu-Briggs, another key member of the family, is the current head of the Oruwari-Briggs House (Iniikeiroari VI). He continues to uphold and build upon the legacy of his father, High Chief O.B. Lulu-Briggs. High Chief O.B. Lulu-Briggs was a towering figure, serving as the Paramount Head of the Oruwari-Briggs War-Canoe House of Abonnema, and holding esteemed titles such as Iniikeiroari V of Kalabari Kingdom and Oruwari VI. His leadership and contributions laid a strong foundation for the family\\'s ongoing prominence.\\n\\nFollowing the death  of High Chief O.B. Lulu-Briggs in late 2018, his wife, Dr. (Mrs.) Seinye O.B. Lulu-Briggs, has emerged as chairman and chief executive of Moni Pulo Limited (MPL), guiding the company with the same visionary approach that her late husband was known for.\\nDr. Seinye\\'s career began in the Computer Department of the Central Bank of Nigeria, where she honed the skills that would later propel her to success in the private sector.\\nRecognized as one of Africa\\'s top 20 most influential women, Dr. Seinye O.B. Lulu-Briggs has made substantial contributions to the Nigerian economy.\\n\\nShe is the driving force behind La Sien Bottling Company, which produces premium beverages, including the well-known La Sien Premium Bottled Water. Additionally, she oversees Soliyama Limited, a company that specializes in haulage, asset-leasing, and manpower management, particularly within the oil and gas industry.\\n\\nLegacy and Influence\\n\\nThe late High Chief O.B. Lulu-Briggs held a profound connection to both the Kalabari Kingdom and the broader Niger Delta region. His state burial was a monumental event, drawing a host of dignitaries from the political, royal, and business spheres, including the 14th President of Nigeria, His Excellency Dr. Goodluck Jonathan (GCFR, GCON), King Dandeson Douglas Jaja V of Opobo, former Nigerian First Lady, Her Excellency Hajia Aisha Buhari, and the former Rivers State Governor, His Excellency Nyesom Wike. The presence of these distinguished figures highlights the significant influence and respect the Briggs family commands in Nigeria.\\nThe Briggs family\\'s legacy is defined by its unwavering commitment to the region, playing a pivotal role in shaping the cultural, political, and economic landscape of Rivers State, the Ijaw tribe, and the entire Niger Delta region.\\n\\n Controversy Surrounding the Oruwari-Briggs House \\nFollowing the passing of High Chief O.B. Lulu-Briggs, the Oruwari-Briggs House became embroiled in a significant controversy that has attracted widespread attention. The dispute centers around his wife, Dr. Seinye O.B. Lulu-Briggs, and her late husband\\'s sons, particularly the elder sons—Senibo Lulu-Briggs, Dumo Lulu-Briggs, and Sofiri Lulu-Briggs. This conflict has created a deep rift within the family and delayed the burial of the esteemed High Chief.\\n\\nDr. Seinye alleges that her late husband\\'s sons are obstructing her from performing the burial rites, accusing them of harassment and attempts to undermine her role as the widow. The sons, led by Dumo Lulu-Briggs, have accused Dr. Seinye of being responsible for their father\\'s death, a charge that has further fueled the family feud. The sons reportedly have the backing of some of the compound chiefs in Abonnema, creating a divide between them and Dr. Seinye, who has the support of her four children and has been closely associated with High Chief O.B. Lulu-Briggs for the past two decades.\\n\\nDespite interventions from prominent figures, including the Amanayabo of Kalabari Kingdom, King Theophilus J.T. Princewill, Amachree XI, who established a committee to mediate the issue, the controversy persisted. Burial dates were repeatedly set and then canceled at the last minute, exacerbating tensions.\\n\\nThe conflict also extended to the legal realm, where the sons sought to halt the reading of High Chief O.B. Lulu-Briggs’ will, claiming it contained specific instructions regarding his funeral. They obtained an injunction from a court in Rivers State to stop the will\\'s reading and later introduced another will purportedly drafted by their father in 2003. This move added another layer of complexity to the already contentious situation.\\n\\nIn June 2019, the conflict took a dramatic turn when Dr. Seinye was detained by the Nigerian Immigration Service upon her return from an overseas trip. Her passport was seized, and she was held for hours before being released, thanks to her lawyer\\'s intervention. This incident, along with a previous detention by police from the Force Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (FCIID) in Abuja, where Dr. Seinye was held for five hours, was seen by many as part of a broader effort to intimidate her by her stepsons.\\n\\nThe roots of this controversy trace back to the early 2000s when the elder sons of High Chief O.B. Lulu-Briggs and other siblings took legal action against their father in multiple courts, including those in Abuja, Lagos, Houston, and London, in a bid to seize control of Moni Pulo Limited, the family\\'s oil exploration company. However, High Chief O.B. Lulu-Briggs successfully defended his position in court, leading to two settlements in which he symbolically “bought” the purported shares of his three eldest sons—Senibo, Dumo, and Sofiri. The agreements stipulated that the sons would relinquish their claims to the company in perpetuity.\\n\\nNow, following High Chief O.B. Lulu-Briggs’ death, the sons appear to be renewing their efforts to claim their father\\'s assets, a move Dr. Seinye believes is aimed at pushing her aside and disregarding the interests of the family\\'s other children. This ongoing dispute has not only delayed the burial of High Chief O.B. Lulu-Briggs but has also cast a shadow over the legacy of the Oruwari-Briggs House, one of the most prominent families in the Niger Delta.\\n\\n Politics \\nThe Briggs family has been a powerful influence in the political landscape of Rivers State for many years. Their involvement spans various significant roles, reflecting their deep-rooted commitment to public service and leadership.\\n\\nRoseberry Robinson Briggs (1925–2013) was a distinguished Nigerian politician and a notable member of the Briggs family. As a member of the National Party of Nigeria, he made significant contributions to the political landscape of Rivers State. Briggs served as the first Speaker of the Rivers State House of Assembly, holding the position for two consecutive terms from 1979 to 1987.\\n\\nIn 2015, Tonye Briggs-Oniyide made notable contributions as the Rivers State Commissioner for Culture and Tourism under former Governor Nyesom Wike, where she played a key role in promoting the state\\'s cultural heritage and tourism potential.\\n\\nHon. Victor Tubotamuno Abiye Briggs has also been an influential political figure, particularly in Abonnema City within the Akuku-Toru Local Government Area, where he has been a key stakeholder in local governance and political decision-making.\\n\\nChief Dumo Lulu-Briggs, another prominent member of the family, has actively pursued political leadership on a larger scale. He ran for the governorship of Rivers State in the 2019 elections under the National Democratic Party and again in the 2023 elections under the Accord Party. His repeated candidacy underscores the family\\'s enduring influence and continued ambition to shape the political future of Rivers State.\\n\\n References \\n\\nCategory:Nigerian royal families\\nCategory:Families from Rivers State',\n"," 'Slough House is a series of spy novels by the British Author Mick Herron.

See also Devincenzi 1925 \\n\\nEtymology\\nThe genus name, Diplodus means \"double toothed\", a description which was not well-explained, but may have been done in reference to the species\\' two types of teeth: incisor-like and molar-like, or to the double incisor-like tooth shape common to this genus. The species name argenteus comes from the Latin word for silver, which is a reference to the fish\\'s coloration, rather than its origin near Argentina, or anything to do with Argentina\\'s etymology.\\n\\nDescription\\nAs its name suggests, this D. argenteus\\'\\'\\' silvery coloration (often with a yellowish tint on the scales and fins) is a significant characteristic of its appearance.  Wells, V. Carpenter, C. 2011. A Field Guide to Coastal Fishes from Maine to Texas. Baltimore. Johns Hopkins University Press. In addition to its main coloring, there are nine dark, narrow bars that can be faintly visible on the anterior portion of its body (especially in younger individuals, as they fade with age), there is also a large, black blotch on the caudal peduncle, and the opercular membrane is also very dark in color.

Able to be caught via angling or through trapping, it makes up a major portion of the catch in the Cabo Frio region of Brazil, but is generally caught incidentally, and is even reported rare from fisheries in other parts of its range such as Cuba. Catches are generally very small and come from Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay, through fishing for this species off the United States East Coast and Brazil once dominated the silver porgy catch for most of the late 20th Century. \\n\\nBecause of its habitat and distribution, this species is often encountered by recreational SCUBA divers and snorklers.  Despite its fairly high probably of being encountered in certain ecosystems, the silver porgy is seldom approaches divers, and generally moves away from divers when approached.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\nIUCN RedList Entry\\nFishBase.org Entry\\n\\nCategory:Sparidae\\nCategory:Fish described in 1830\\nCategory:Taxa named by Achille Valenciennes\\nCategory:Fish of the Caribbean\\nCategory:Fish of South America\\nCategory:Fish of the Atlantic Ocean',\n"," 'Clubul Sportiv Local Ștefănești, also known as CSL Ștefănești, or simply as Ștefănești is a Romanian football club based in Ștefăneștii de Jos, Ilfov County, which currently plays in Liga III, the third tier of Romanian football.\\n\\nHistory\\nThe club was founded in 1997 and played mostly in the amateur leagues.\\n\\nThe team coached by Florin Vlădilă won the Liga IV – Ilfov County at the end of the 2010–11 season and promoted to Liga III winning the promotion play-off against Viață Nouă Olteni, the winner of Liga IV – Teleorman County, 3–1 at Marin Anastasovici Stadium in Giurgiu.

The crash resulted in the deaths of all 25 people on board.\\n\\n Aircraft \\nThe Il-14P with factory number 146000701 and serial number 07-01 was manufactured by the \"Banner of Labor\" factory (Moscow) on June 28, 1956. It was subsequently sold to the Main Directorate of Civil Air Fleet under the Council of Ministers of the USSR. The aircraft was registered with the number CCCP-Л1863 and assigned to the 107th (Baku) aviation detachment of the Azerbaijan territorial administration of the civil air fleet. In 1959, following re-registration, the tail number changed to CCCP-41863. At the time of the crash, the aircraft had accumulated 3,922 flight hours.\\n\\n Crew \\nThe crew from the 107th flight detachment consisted of 5 members:\\n Captain – Ivan Sergeyevich Mandrykin\\n Co-pilot – Kim Leonidovich Mareev\\n Flight Engineer – Maggerm Mukhtarovich Ibragimov\\n Radio Operator – Vitaly Ivanovich Kaurov\\n Stewardess – Nelli Yemelyanovna Piskunova\\n\\n Crash \\nThe aircraft was operating flight 205 from Moscow to Baku with intermediate stops in Voronezh and Stalingrad. At 23:30 on January 17, it departed from Vnukovo Airport (Moscow) and landed at Voronezh Airport at 01:00 on January 18. After a 45-minute layover, the aircraft, carrying 5 crew members and 20 passengers, departed for Stalingrad. During the flight, at 02:07, the crew received a weather forecast for Gumrak Airport indicating continuous stratiform rain clouds and fracto-rain clouds with a lower boundary of 250 meters, snow, and visibility of 2 kilometers. At 02:25, the aircraft entered the Stalingrad Air Traffic Control Center\\'s zone, flying above the clouds. At 03:07, the aircraft reported entering the airport\\'s airspace at an altitude of 2,400 meters between cloud layers and requested approach and landing conditions. Permission was granted to perform an approach at 1,200 meters. Gumrak Airport was equipped with a landing system (OSP) only on the eastern side with a landing course of 243°. However, a northeast wind (60°) blew on that day, making a tailwind for the 243° landing course, which made landing from the eastern side impossible. In such conditions, the crew had to follow a rectangular route and penetrate the cloud cover, descend to 150 meters, align with a course of 243°, then make the fourth turn and pass the OMP with the IMP, perform a visual approach on course 63° to runway 24 by a left-hand circuit.\\n\\nWhen the crew reported reaching 1,200 meters, the dispatcher permitted descent to 900 meters, to which the crew responded: Seeing it visually. Soon, clearance was given for 400 meters, which the crew confirmed. When asked by the dispatcher if they had the runway threshold in sight, the response was negative. Then, from aircraft 41863, it was reported that they were passing the OMP at 400 meters on a course of 153° and proceeding to the second turn. The crew successively reported passing the second, third, and fourth turns at 400 meters. After the report of completing the fourth turn, the flight leader inquired about the possibility of visual flight, to which an affirmative answer was given. However, contact with the aircraft was lost afterward. There was also no report on passing the OMP. At 03:33, flying on a course of 315° with a right bank of 15—20° and a pitch of 9—12°, the Il-14, traveling at approximately 300 km/h, crashed into a snow-covered field 4,025 meters from the OMP and about 5,000 meters from the runway 24 threshold. The right wing struck the ground first and broke apart upon impact, causing the aircraft to overturn and sever the tail section. The wreckage was scattered over 300—350 meters, and no fire ensued, but all 25 people on board perished.\\n\\n Investigation \\nFrom the outset, the crash was noted for its strange nature: performing a visual flight, the aircraft began a strong deviation to the right between the fourth turn and the OMP as if the crew were not in control. At this time, there was continuous stratiform rain cloud cover at 163 meters, mist, and visibility of up to 4 kilometers, meaning that the weather conditions given the crew\\'s training could not have caused the crash. It was also established that 19 tickets were sold for the flight, but there was an additional stowaway passenger on board. Moreover, one of the passengers traveling from Moscow to Baku was sent a telegram to Stalingrad Airport with a suspicious text: Everyone is healthy in Moscow; I find it advisable to return by train. This raised a theory of a possible attack on the crew. However, the commander\\'s pistol found at the crash site was discovered fully loaded. Examination of the wreckage showed that the engines were running at the time of impact and the aircraft was under control.\\n\\nWhen the bodies of the crew members were examined, a round wound 5 centimeters deep with burn marks around the edges was found on the left thigh of the commander, Mandrykin. Initially, the forensic examination concluded that the wound resulted from electric shock, although it could not determine whether the wound was inflicted before or after death. However, a more detailed examination of the wreckage revealed five round holes, 10 and 35 millimeters in diameter, located in the skin and partition of the cockpit and the left control panel of the engine management. The commission noted that between 3 and 5 in the morning, in the area of the GUMRAK settlement near the crash site, a military unit conducted firing exercises. Additionally, in the following three months, about ten reports were received from aircraft commanders of various planes stating that during approaches from the west side from the fourth turn to the OMP, when planes flew over the military range, tracer rounds and shell bursts were observed dangerously close to them. In April, an exhumation of the commander\\'s body was conducted. A re-examination found small metal fragments in the left thigh in the burn area and a cylindrical metal object measuring 11×5 millimeters. Thus, the initial conclusion that the wound resulted from an electric shock was refuted.\\n\\nThe commission decided to conduct an examination to prove that the metallic objects found in the commander\\'s body were a bullet fired from a firearm. Based on these findings, a petition could be filed with the Ministry of Defense of the USSR to close the military range located in the rectangular approach route area on course 243°, as regular firing drills, both day and night, were held there, creating a clear threat to the safety of aircraft flying over the range. However, the commission made no final conclusion, leaving the cause of the crash officially undetermined.\\n\\n Notes \\n\\nCategory:January 1959 events\\nCategory:Accidents and incidents involving the Ilyushin Il-14\\nCategory:Airliner shootdown incidents',\n"," \"Kappa Phi Kappa is an American professional fraternity for students in education.

Art, Design, and Visual Thinking. An online, interactive textbook. Cornell.edu, 1995. Painter and design theorist Maitland E. Graves (1902–1978), who attempted to gestate the fundamental principles of aesthetic order in visual design,Martin, Jon Henry. An evaluation of Maitland Graves\\' principle of aesthetic order. Masters thesis, Concordia University, 1972. in his book, The Art of Color and Design (1941), defined the elements of design as line, direction, shape, size, texture, value, and color, concluding that \"these elements are the materials from which all designs are built.\"Graves, Maitland, E. The art of color and design. 2d ed. New York, N.Y.: McGraw-Hill, 1951.thumb|right|Elements of art and designthumb|Color star containing primary, secondary, and tertiary colors.|180x180px\\n\\nColor\\nColor is the result of light reflecting back from an object to our eyes. The color that our eyes perceive is determined by the pigment of the object itself. Color theory and the color wheel are often referred to when studying color combinations in visual design. Color is often deemed to be an important element of design as it is a universal language which presents the countless possibilities of visual communication. Color serves various purposes to contribute to the overall effectiveness of the design. It is used as an element to convey meaning and emotion, create visual hierarchy, enhance brand identity, improve readability and accessibility, create visual interest and appeal, differentiate information and elements, and make cultural and contextual significance.\\n\\nHue, saturation, and brightness are the three characteristics that describe color.\\n\\nHue can simply be referred to as \"color\" as in red, yellow, or green.\\nSaturation gives a color brightness or dullness, which impacts the vibrance of the color.\\nValues, tints and shades of colors are created by adding black to a color for a shade and white for a tint. Creating a tint or shade of color reduces the saturation.\\n\\n Color theory in visual design \\nColor theory studies color mixing and color combinations. It is one of the first things that marked a progressive design approach. In visual design, designers refer to color theory as a body of practical guidance to achieving certain visual impacts with specific color combinations. Theoretical color knowledge is implemented in designs in order to achieve a successful color design.\\n\\nColor harmony\\n\\nColor harmony, often referred to as a \"measure of aesthetics\", studies which color combinations are harmonious and pleasing to the eye, and which color combinations are not. Color harmony is a main concern for designers given that colors always exist in the presence of other colors in form or space.\\n\\nWhen a designer harmonizes colors, the relationships among a set of colors are enhanced to increase the way they complement one another. Colors are harmonized to achieve a balanced, unified, and aesthetically pleasing effect for the viewer.\\n\\nColor harmony is achieved in a variety of ways, some of which consist of combining a set of colors that share the same hue, or a set of colors that share the same values for two of the three color characteristics (hue, saturation, brightness). Color harmony can also be achieved by simply combining colors that are considered compatible to one another as represented in the color wheel.\\n\\nColor contrasts\\n\\nColor contrasts are studied with a pair of colors, as opposed to color harmony, which studies a set of colors. In color contrasting, two colors with perceivable differences in aspects such as luminance, or saturation, are placed side by side to create contrast.\\n\\nJohannes Itten presented seven kinds of color contrasts: contrast of light and dark, contrast of hue, contrast of temperature, contrast of saturation, simultaneous contrast, contrast of sizes, and contrast of complementary. These seven kinds of color contrasts have inspired past works involving color schemes in design.\\n\\nColor schemes\\n\\nColor schemes are defined as the set of colors chosen for a design. They are often made up of two or more colors that look appealing beside one another, and that create an aesthetic feeling when used together. Color schemes depend on color harmony as they point to which colors look pleasing beside one another.\\n\\nA satisfactory design product is often accompanied by a successful color scheme. Over time, color design tools with the function of generating color schemes were developed to facilitate color harmonizing for designers.\\n\\n Use of color in visual design \\n\\n Color is used to create harmony, balance, and visual comfort in a design\\n Color is used to evoke the desired mood and emotion in the viewer\\n Color is used to create a theme in the design\\n Color holds meaning and can be symbolic. In certain cultures, different colors can have different meanings.\\n Color is used to put emphasis on desired elements and create visual hierarchy in a piece of art\\n Color can create identity for a certain brand or design product\\nColor allows viewers to have different interpretations of visual designs. The same color can evoke different emotions, or have various meanings to different individuals and cultures\\nColor strategies are used for organization and consistency in a design product\\nIn the architectural design of a retail environment, colors affect decision-making, making which motivates consumers to buy particular products\\nColor strengthens narrative and storytelling in visual design. \\nColor can represent characters, themes, and symbolism. \\nColor is a tool that designers use to strategically add layers of meaning and subtext to their designs. \\nColors can create recurring visual motifs in a design, strengthening ideas and fostering coherence. \\nColor is an effective tool for communication because it allows for complex interpretation and expression.\\n\\nthumb|right|Similarly, stars in a constellation connected via imaginary lines are a natural example of using lines in a composition\\n\\nLine\\nThe line is an element of art defined by a point moving in space. . More specifically, Line is defined as a series of points, or the connection between two points, or the path of a moving point. The importance of line comes from its versatility as its characteristics is significantly expressive. Lines can be vertical, horizontal, diagonal, or curved, they may also appear as linear shapes that take on a line-link quality, or as suggested line perceived from eyes as they follow a sequence related shapes. Line may be used either in two-dimensional forms with enclosing a space as an outline and creating shape, or in three-dimensional forms.  They can be any width or texture, and can be continuous, implied, or broken. On top of that, there are different types of lines aside from the ones previously mentioned. For example, you could have a line that is horizontal and zigzagged or a line that is vertical and zigzagged. Different lines create different moods, it all depends on what mood you are using line to create and convey.\\n\\n Point \\nA point is basically the beginning of “something” in “nothing”. It forces the mind to think upon its position and gives something to build upon in both imagination and space. Some abstract points in a group can provoke human imagination to link it with familiar shapes or forms.\\n\\nShape\\n\\nA shape is defined as a two dimensional area that stands out from the space next to or around it due to a defined or implied boundary, or because of differences of value, color, or texture. Shapes are recognizable objects and forms and are usually composed of other elements of design.\\n\\nFor example, a square that is drawn on a piece of paper is considered a shape. It is created with a series of lines which serve as a boundary that shapes the square and separates it from the space around it that is not part of the square.\\n\\nTypes of shapes\\nGeometric shapes or mechanical shapes are shapes that can be drawn using a ruler or compass, such as squares, circles, triangles, ellipses, parallelograms, stars, and so on. Mechanical shapes, whether simple or complex, produce a feeling of control and order.\\n\\nOrganic shapes are irregular shapes that are often complex and resemble shapes that are found in nature. Organic shapes can be drawn by hand, which is why they are sometimes subjective and only exist in the imagination of the artist.\\n\\nCurvilinear shapes are composed of curved lines and smooth edges. They give off a more natural feeling to the shape. In contrast, rectilinear shapes are composed of sharp edges and right angles, and give off a sense of order in the composition. They look more human-made, structured, and artificial. Artists can choose to create a composition that revolves mainly around one of these styles of shape, or they can choose to combine both.\\n\\nTexture\\n\\nthumb|This is only a two dimensional image of a tree, but appears to have the texture of three dimensional bark.\\nTexture refers to the physical and visual qualities of a surface.\\n\\n Definition of texture \\nTexture is the variation of data at a scale smaller than the scale of the main object. Taking a person wearing a Hawaiian shirt as an example, as long as we consider the person as the main object looking at, the patterns of their shirt are considered as texture. However, if we try to identify the pattern of the shirt, each flower or bird of the pattern is a non-textured object, as no smaller detail inside of it can be recognized. Texture in our environment helps us to better understand the nature of things, as a smooth paved road signals safe passage and thick fog creates a veil on our view.\\n\\n Texture in design \\nTexture in design includes the literal physical surface employed in a printed piece as well as the optical appearance of the surface. Physical texture affects how the piece feels in hand and also how it conveys the design, as a glossy surface for example reflects the light differently than a soft or pebbly one. Many of the textures manipulated by graphic designers, however, cannot be physically experienced as it is utilized in the visual representation aspect of the design. Texture adds detail to an image in a way that conveys the overall quality of a surface. Graphic designers use texture to establish a mood, reinforce a point of view, or convey a sense of physical presence whether setting a type or drawing a tree.\\n\\n Uses of texture in design \\n\\n Texture can be used to attract or repel interest to an element, depending on how pleasant the texture is perceived to be. \\n Texture can also be used to add complex detail into the composition of a design. \\n In theatrical design, the surface qualities of a costume sculpt the look and feel of a character, which influences the way the audience reacts to the character.\\n\\nTypes of texture\\n\\nTactile texture, also known as \"actual texture\", refers to the physical three-dimensional texture of an object. Tactile texture can be perceived by the sense of touch. A person can feel the tactile texture of a sculpture by running their hand over its surface and feelings its ridges and dents.\\n\\n Painters use impasto to build peaks and create texture in their painting.\\n Texture can be created through collage. This is when artists assemble three dimensional objects and apply them onto a two-dimensional surface, like a piece of paper or canvas, to create one final composition.\\n Papier collé is another collaging technique in which artists glue paper to a surface to create different textures on its surface.\\n Assemblage is a technique that consists of assembling various three-dimensional objects into a sculpture, which can also reveal textures to the viewer.\\n\\nVisual texture, also referred to as \"implied texture\", is not detectable by our sense of touch, but by our sense of sight. Visual texture is the illusion of a real texture on a two-dimensional surface. Any texture perceived in an image or photograph is a visual texture. A photograph of rough tree bark is considered a visual texture. It creates the impression of a real texture on a two-dimensional surface which would remain smooth to the touch no matter how rough the represented texture is.\\n\\nIn painting, different paints are used to achieve different types of textures. Paints such as oil, acrylic, and encaustic are thicker and more opaque and are used to create three-dimensional impressions on the surface. Other paints, such as watercolor, tend to be used for visual textures, because they are thinner and have transparency, and do not leave much tactile texture on the surface.\\n\\n Pattern \\nMany textures appear to repeat the same motif. When a motif is repeated over and over again in a surface, it results in a pattern. Patterns are frequently used in fashion design or textile design, where motifs are repeated to create decorative patterns on fabric or other textile materials. Patterns are also used in architectural design, where decorative structural elements such as windows, columns, or pediments, are incorporated into building design.\\n\\nSpace\\nIn design, space is concerned with the area deep within the moment of designated design, the design will take place on. For a two-dimensional design, space concerns creating the illusion of a third dimension on a flat surface:\\n\\nOverlap is the effect where objects appear to be on top of each other. This illusion makes the top element look closer to the observer. There is no way to determine the depth of the space, only the order of closeness.\\nShading adds gradation marks to make an object of a two-dimensional surface seem three-dimensional.\\nHighlight, Transitional Light, Core of the Shadow, Reflected Light, and Cast Shadow give an object a three-dimensional look.\\nLinear Perspective is the concept relating to how an object seems smaller the farther away it gets.\\nAtmospheric Perspective is based on how air acts as a filter to change the appearance of distant objects.\\n\\nForm\\nIn visual design, form is described as the way an artist arranges elements in the entirety of a composition. It may also be described as any three-dimensional object. Form can be measured, from top to bottom (height), side to side (width), and from back to front (depth). Form is also defined by light and dark. It can be defined by the presence of shadows on surfaces or faces of an object. There are two types of form, geometric (artificial) and natural (organic form). Form may be created by the combining of two or more shapes. It may be enhanced by tone, texture or color. It can be illustrated or constructed.\\n\\nSee also\\n Composition (visual arts)\\n Interior design\\n Landscape design\\n Pattern language\\n Elements of art\\n Color theory\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nReferences\\nKilmer, R., & Kilmer, W.

In 1859, Prince Regent Wilhelm approved a construction program for some fifty-two gunboats to be built over the next fifteen years, which began with the fifteen vessels of the Jäger class.\\n\\nWolf was  long overall, with a beam of  and a draft of . She displaced  normally and  at full load. The ship's crew consisted of 2\\xa0officers and 38\\xa0enlisted men. She was powered by a pair of marine steam engines that drove one 3-bladed screw propeller, with steam provided by four coal-fired trunk boilers, which gave her a top speed of  at . As built, she was equipped with a three-masted schooner rig. The ship was armed with a battery of one rifled 24-pounder muzzle-loading gun and two rifled 12-pounder muzzle-loading guns.\\n\\nService history\\nWolf was built at the Liegnitz shipyard in Grabow. Her keel was laid down in 1859 and she was launched on 29 April 1860. The ship was not commissioned upon completion, and she was instead towed to Stralsund, where she was laid up on the nearby island of Dänholm. While out of service, her copper sheathing was removed from her hull so ventilation holes could be cut into the outer planking. Her entire propulsion system, including the masts and the funnel, was removed and a roof was erected over the hull to keep the elements out.\\n\\nWolf was first commissioned on 21 February 1864 after the start of the Second Schleswig War against Denmark. She was assigned to III Flotilla Division. III and V\\xa0Divisions were based in Stralsund to defend the Kubitzer Bodden and the Bay of Greifswald. In the aftermath of the Battle of Jasmund in mid-March, Prince Adalbert, the Prussian naval commander, ordered all five gunboat divisions to concentrate at Stralsund on 29 March to support the Prussian Army's invasion of the island of Als, but bad weather prevented the vessels from taking part in the operation. Following a ceasefire in May, the Prussian fleet held a naval review in Swinemünde for King Wilhelm I on 6 June; the aviso  led the gunboat divisions during the review. Also in May, the ship was temporarily commanded by  (Ensign) Friedrich von Hollmann. The ceasefire did not hold, and Wolf participated in a battle with Danish naval forces off Hiddensee on 3 July. On 23 September, Wolf was decommissioned and placed back in reserve at Dänholm.\\n\\nThe ship returned to service on 3 April 1866 to carry out surveys of Prussia's North Sea coast, initially under the command of  (ULzS–Sub-lieutenant at Sea) Conrad Dietert, but later in May, he was replaced by  Otto Zembsch. She departed Kiel in company with Loreley on 22 April, bound for the Jade Bight. The outbreak of the Austro-Prussian War in June interrupted the survey work, and Wolf was assigned to a flotilla led by the ironclad . The unit also included several other vessels, including Loreley and the gunboats  and ; the ships had assembled at Hamburg in early June, shortly before the start of the war on 14 June. The following day, the Kingdom of Hannover entered the war against Prussia, and because the Austrian fleet was confined to the Adriatic Sea, the Prussian navy concentrated its effort against the Hannoverians. During these operations, Wolf and Tiger bombarded Hannoverian coastal artillery at the mouth of the Elbe. On 24 June, Wolf towed four barges loaded with captured Hannoverian rifles and ammunition to Altona. After operations against Hannover ended, the ship returned to survey work, which lasted until her decommissioning on 10 November in Geestemünde.\\n\\nWolf next recommissioned on 24 April 1867 for further survey work, this time in company with Loreley and the gunboat . She was decommissioned for the winter on 26 October, and she returned to service the following year on 21 April. But in 1868, budget conflicts between the navy and the  caused a shortage of funds that necessitated the decommissioning of Wolf already on 6 May. Shortages of crewmen kept the ship out of service at Geestemünde in 1869. Wolf finally returned to service on 1 June 1870 to replace the ironclad  as the station ship in Altona, but the start of the Franco-Prussian War the following month saw her transferred to guard the entrance to Jade Bay. In September, ULzS Franz Strauch took command of the ship. In May 1871, with the war over, Wolf returned to survey duty in the North Sea, which lasted until her decommissioning on 19 June. The ship was reactivated in August 1872 to serve as a tender for the artillery training ship . On 11 December, she sailed to Kiel, but icy conditions prevented her from reaching the port, and she had to turn back to Wilhelmshaven, where she was decommissioned on 31 December. Wolf was briefly recommissioned in April 1873 to sail through the Eider Canal to Kiel, where she was decommissioned again on 2 May. She was struck from the naval register on 26 September 1875, converted into a naval mine storage hulk, and was renamed  Nr. 2 (Mine Barge No. 2). The vessel was eventually sunk as a target ship by the torpedo testing ship  during tests outside Kiel on 4 August 1884. Her wreck was later raised and broken up.\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nReferences\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nCategory:Jäger-class gunboats\\nCategory:1860 ships\",\n"," 'Nick Nash  is an American football wide receiver for the San Jose State Spartans.\\n\\n Early life and high school \\nNash attended and played football and baseball at Woodbridge High School in Irvine, California.

He was born in Riga, in what was at the time the Governorate of Livonia of the Russian Empire. His family was wealthy and influential. From 1841, he studied law at the University of Tartu, and eventually settled in Tartu and pursued a long academic career. Upon his retirement in 1874, he moved to Wiesbaden in present-day Germany and was given the char of international law at Heidelberg University, which he maintained until his death. He was one of the founding members of the Institut de Droit International.\\n\\nHis academic work focused on the theoretical underpinnings of international law. He insisted on the separation between law and politics, following in the liberal tradition of Friedrich Carl von Savigny. In his legal positivist view, an expanding legal order and a legalisation of international relations was an important part of a broader, teleological civilisational progression which mankind was engaged in, and which would lead away from a more capricious political order to a predictable, law-based order.\\n\\nPolitically he was a conservative, whose views of contemporary political issues were closely linked to his identity as a Lutheran and a Baltic German.\\n\\nBiography\\nAugust von Bulmerincq came from a wealthy Baltic German family. The family traced its origins to Scotland which had settled in Lübeck in the 17th century. In 1677 the family had moved from there to Riga, where August von Bulmerincq was born. At the time of his birth, Riga was part of the Russian Empire, and the administrative centre of the Governorate of Livonia. His father was a successful merchant and an alderman at the Great Guild in Riga. Many of his ancestors had served in the administration of the Russian Empire as civil servants, officers, scholars, doctors and architects.\\n\\nAugust von Bulmerincq moved to Tartu (at the time known mainly by its German name Dorpat) and began studying law in 1841. At the time, the language of instruction at the University of Tartu was German. He became a candidate of law in 1847 and then briefly attended Heidelberg University, before returning to his native land in 1848 on account of the Revolutions of 1848. He began practicing law in Riga, and at the same time continued his legal studies. In 1849 he attained his master\\'s degree. He remained in Riga until 1853, when he moved permanently to Tartu to pursue his academic career. He attained the degree of Privatdozent in 1854. Two years later he produced his doctoral thesis, and from then on worked mainly in the field of international law. The subject had been only tentatively studied and taught in Tartu before. From 1858 he was ordinary professor in public law, international law and politics. He stayed in Tartu until his retirement in 1874. The year before his retirement, he was invited to participate at the founding of the Institut de Droit International in Ghent, but could not attend since the invitation did not reach him in time. He was later however counted among the founding members, and would become one of its most active members. During his time as professor, a number of works focused on the theory and history of international law were produced under his supervision; among his students were statistician and economist .\\nthumb|right|The main building of the University of Tartu, where August von Bulmerincq spent most of his academic career.\\nBesides his academic career, Bulmerincq was also active in philanthropic societies and in public life. In 1863 he founded a journal dedicated to economy and agriculture, and he was also the organiser of the first agricultural congress in the present-day Baltic states.\\n\\nAfter his retirement, Bulmerincq moved to Wiesbaden in present-day Germany. Following the death of Johann Kaspar Bluntschli, Bulmerincq was given the char of international law at Heidelberg University, which he maintained until his death. He died in Stuttgart on 18 August 1890.\\n\\nContributions to international law\\nAugust von Bulmerincq belonged to an influential, early generation of scholars of international law, and contributed to forming the modern specialisation and understanding of the discipline. His main interest was in the theoretical foundations of international law. He is considered one of the most important German-speaking legal scholars of his generation. Bulmerincq worked in the tradition of Friedrich Carl von Savigny and had a broadly liberal view of international law, contrasting with views of scholars such as Karl von Gareis who adhered to a worldview grounded in Realpolitik thought. Bulmerincq was a legal positivist and argued that on the international arena, it was important to separate law from politics. While acknowledging that both politics and law are used by states to further their interests (in Bulmerincq\\'s view, politics tend to favour short-term interests, while a legal order favours long-term interests), the main distinction between politics and law for Bulmerincq lay, according to legal historian , in the \"absence or presence of the choice of will. While politics could choose the means that seemed appropriate in particular circumstances, in law there was only one rule that had to be applied correctly.\" Furthermore, in his view an expanding legal order and a legalisation of international relations was an important part of a broader, teleological civilisational progression which mankind was engaged in, and which would lead away from a more capricious political order to a predictable, law-based order.\\n\\nPolitical views\\nthumb|right|Map of Livonia from the 16th century. Bulmerincq expressed regret that Livonia lost its unity following the Livonian War.\\nIn contrast to his overarching liberal legal outlook, Bulmerincq was a political conservative, whose views of contemporary political issues were closely linked to his identity as a Lutheran and a Baltic German. He was opposed to contemporary attempts at Russification in the Baltic provinces of the Russian Empire, but did not engage himself in this conflict very actively. Bulmerincq considered Baltic Germans to be culturally superior to Estonians and Latvians, though he admitted that wider inclusion of non-Germans was a necessity, and had an essentially colonial attitude to these peoples. Similarly, in his legal work he distinguished between countries he considered \"civilised\" and subjected to certain legal norms, and countries and peoples which he did not consider part of this \"family of nations\". He viewed the German settlement and Germanisation of the Baltic lands during the Middle Ages as positive, and expressed nostalgia and disappointment for the lost unity of Old Livonia. He was in favour of the Unification of Germany, and he opposed socialism; these views coincided with those of Otto von Bismarck, and Bulmerincq publicly announced them in connection with his move to Germany in 1874.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nSources cited\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nExternal links\\n\\nCategory:1822 births\\nCategory:1890 deaths\\nCategory:Baltic-German people from the Russian Empire\\nCategory:People from Riga\\nCategory:Legal scholars from the Russian Empire\\nCategory:International law scholars\\nCategory:University of Tartu alumni\\nCategory:Heidelberg University alumni\\nCategory:Members of the Institut de Droit International',\n"," \"Shatananda (Sanskrit: शतानंद) was a Vedic sage and the chief priest at the court of the King Janaka in ancient Mithila.

The meaning of the first term Shata is hundred and good. And the meaning of the second term Ananda is who delights. Thus the compound meaning of the word Shatananda is to give somebody hundred times good and great pleasure.\\n\\n Early life \\nAccording to Ramayana, Shatananda was born in the region of ancient Mithila Kingdom. His father was Maharshi Gautama and mother was Ahalya. He was the eldest son of the couple Maharshi Gautama and Ahalya. \\n\\n Description \\nIn Ramayana, Shatananda was a member of the court of King Janaka. He is mentioned as the Kulguru of the King Janaka. He was the chief priest and religious advisor at the court of King Janaka. He taught King Janaka about religious practices and philosophies. Once when there was a big famine in Mithila Kingdom, then it was Guru Shatananda who suggested King Janaka that the problem could be solved if he ploughed the field himself.  He was also appointed by the King Janaka as a teacher of the princess Sita. It is said that he was radiant due to the practice of Yoga. \\n\\nDuring Sita Swayamvara ceremony, sage Shatananda and King Janaka welcomed and gave due respect to Guru Vishwamitra along with his disciples princes Rama and Lakshmana. Shatananda was very happy to know that Lord Rama had restored his mother Ahalya's old purity. After knowing that the prince Rama had freed his mother Ahalya from the curse given by his father Maharshi Gautama, then sage Shatananda thanked a lot to Lord Rama. He also narrated the story of greatness of the Guru Vishwamitra to Lord Rama and Lakshmana. Shatananda played the role of high-priest in the marriage of Lord Rama and Goddess Sita.

The building, which was previously the offices and meeting place of Ardrossan Burgh Council, is currently used as a masonic hall.\\n\\nHistory\\nFollowing significant growth in population, largely associated with the status of Ardrossan as a seaport, and following extensive lobbying by Hugh Montgomerie, 12th Earl of Eglinton whose seat was at Eglinton Castle, the area became a burgh in 1846. In this context the new burgh leaders decided to commission a town hall: the site they selected was at the corner of Harbour Street and Princes Street. The foundation stone for the new building was laid by the factor of the Eglinton Castle estate, George Johnstone Redburn, with full masonic honours, on 30 October 1858.\\n\\nThe old town hall was designed in the neoclassical style, built in red sandstone and completed in around 1859. The design involved an asymmetrical frontage extending for four bays along each of the two streets. The Princes Street elevation featured a round headed opening with a rusticated surround in the right hand bay. It was fenestrated with casement windows on the ground floor and with sash windows with alternating segmental and triangular pediments on the first floor and there was a parapet above. A clock, with a stone surround and an acroterion above, was presented by the then provost, John Hogarth, and unveiled at the corner of the building above the parapet in June 1887.\\n\\nIn the 19th century, Justice of the Peace court hearings were typically held in the town hall. Meanwhile, a police station was subsequently established on the opposite side of Princes Street.\\n\\nThe building continued to serve as the offices and meeting place for Ardrossan Burgh Council for most of the first half of the 20th century, but ceased to be the local seat of government when the council sold the old town hall to the local masonic lodge, in an exchange of properties involving a building known as Castlecraigs, in August 1946.\\n\\nAfter being damaged in a storm, the mechanical clock on the old town hall was given an electric mechanism in November 1983, and the exterior of the building was cleaned, with financial support from the Historic Buildings Council for Scotland, in late 1997. The building continues to accommodate the offices and meeting place of the local masonic lodge.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nCategory:Government buildings completed in 1859\\nCategory:City chambers and town halls in Scotland\\nCategory:Ardrossan−Saltcoats−Stevenston',\n"," 'thumb|185px|Wilhelm Meyer, from the Svenskt Porträttgalleri XX (1901)\\nWilhelm Fredrik Meyer (6 June 1844, Stockholm - 10 November 1944, Stockholm)  was a Swedish artist and xylographer.\\n\\nBiography\\nHe was born to the lithographer, Johan Fredrik Meyer, a German immigrant, and his wife Catharina Therese née Rosenthal (1814–1896).

This squadron, based in Mumbai, was officially established in October 1991 with a complement of ten Veer-class and three Prabal-class missile boats. However, the roots of the Killer Squadron trace back to 1969, when the Indian Navy inducted Osa-class missile boats from the Soviet Union. These vessels were transported to India on heavy lift merchant ships and were commissioned in early 1971 at Kolkata. The squadron quickly demonstrated its prowess in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, playing a decisive role in the conflict.\\n\\n History \\nThe Killer Squadron earned its name through its heroic actions during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. On the night of December 4–5, 1971, the squadron launched a surprise offensive, codenamed Operation Trident, against the Pakistan Navy. The Indian Navy ships INS Nirghat, INS Nipat, and INS Veer fired their Styx missiles, sinking the Pakistan Navy destroyer PNS Khyber and the minesweeper PNS Muhafiz. This operation dealt a significant blow to the Pakistan Navy, with no casualties sustained by the Indian forces.\\n\\nFollowing this, on the night of December 8–9, 1971, the squadron executed another successful operation, Operation Python. The INS Vinash, accompanied by two frigates, launched four Styx missiles, sinking the Pakistan Navy\\'s fleet tanker PNS Dacca and causing significant damage to the Keamari Oil Storage Facility in Karachi. The Indian forces did not suffer any casualties during this operation.\\n\\nThe success of these operations not only established the Killer Squadron\\'s reputation but also led to December 4 being celebrated as Navy Day in India, commemorating the squadron\\'s decisive role in the 1971 war.\\n Formation \\nThe 22nd Missile Vessel Squadron\\'s vessels are named in honor of the legendary 25th Killer Missile Boat Squadron, known for its daring actions during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. This includes their pivotal roles in Operation Trident and Operation Python, where they were instrumental in sinking multiple Pakistani naval vessels.\\n\\nThe last two ships of the Veer-class in this squadron were upgraded to Tarantul V models. These vessels were outfitted with advanced weaponry, including 16 SS-N-25 \\'Switchblade\\' (URAN E) missiles, an OTO Melara 76 mm naval gun, and the MR 352 Positiv-E (NATO: Cross Dome) radar system.\\n\\nOn April 28, 2016, INS Veer and INS Nipat, two of the oldest Veer-class corvettes, were decommissioned, marking the end of an era for the Indian Navy.\\nthumb|Missile boat of the Killer Squadron firing.\\n\\n Legacy and honours \\nThe year 2021 marked the 50th anniversary of the 1971 victory, celebrated nationwide as Swarnim Vijay Varsh.

He was a courtier of Inca emperor Huayna Capac, surviving the civil war between his successor Huáscar and Atahualpa before allying with Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro. He converted to Christianity under the name of Francisco Zaraunanta Chilche and became Pizarro's leading native supporter, eventually becoming governor of the valley of Yucay. Although obscure in modern historiography, he has been deemed one of the most powerful kuraka of Peruvian history.\\n\\nEarly life\\nAccording to Mestizo chronicler Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, who treated him personally, Chilche became a page for Huayna Capac thanks to his rank as a prince of the Cañari. Although he kept his royal status during the reign of Emperor Atahualpa, he seems to have secretly opposed him, as he quickly pledged himself to Francisco Pizarro in 1533 after Atahualpa's capture in Cajamarca. Chilche was the leader of a faction of Cañari and Chachapoya noblemen within the Cusco nobility, and offered their services to the conquistador.Arana Bustamante, L. (2009) Un incidente en la vida de Francisco Chilche, kuraka del valle de Yucay (1555). Investigaciones sociales, Vol.13 N°23, pp.171-186\\n\\nSpanish conquest of the Inca Empire\\nChilche acted as a general of Indian auxiliaries in Pizarro's composite army. He faced personally the Atahualpist general Chalcuchima, whom Chilche defeated and forced to retreat in Jauja.\\n\\nHis most distinguished moment came during the 1536 siege of Cusco by the revolted Inca army of Manco Inca, of whom Chilche had been a former friend. One of Manco's captains approached the city's walls to challenge the defenders to a duel of champions, to which Chilche asked and obtained permission from Hernando Pizarro to accept the challenge. He armed himself with a chuqui (lance) and a champí (an axe-bladed mace) and fought the Inca, eventually killing him and taking his head as a trophy. The Spanish acclaimed Chilche for the victory, while the Inca considered it a bad omen due to the Cañari having been previously an ethnicity despised under Inca rule. The siege was later lifted by reinforcements by Diego de Almagro.\\n\\nHis role in Pizarro's entourage was instrumental to gain the loyalty of the majority of the Cañari resident in Cusco, who except by Chilche's aides had declined to pick a side in order to wait to see which would take the advantage during the conquest. For his political and military prowess, Chilche was rewarded with the rich valley of Yucay, replacing the former Atahualpist governor, Huallpa Túpac. Francisco Pizarro and his mestizo son Gonzalo retained the titular ownership of the valley, but they passed its management to Chilche, making him de facto one of the most powerful men in the Inca Empire under Spanish rule.\\n\\nGovernor of Yucay\\nthumb|Corpus Christi in Cuzco, with the Cañari parade at the left.\\nIn 1548, Chilche was sued by García Quispi Capi, a descendant of the deposed Huallpa Túpac. The Cañari was forced to hand over lordship over the local aillu while retaining the mitma and the job of governor, but he later gathered an army and attacked García, recovering by force everything he had given away. This attracted complaints from other native landowners and from the very Spanish administration, which went largely unaddressed due to his influence. Chilche was at the peak of a practically feudal network of influence, attracting many native noblemen as clients and receiving women from their families as concubines in order to secure their deals. Only the progressive regularization of the Spanish rule would make his power gradually decline, although he retained a lot of it thanks to his relationship with the Pizarro family.\\n\\nDuring the native parade of Corpus Christy in June 1555, Chilche featured a notorious incident evidencing the political tensions between Inca and Cañari factions. He arrived in a litter decorated with scenes of the Spanish conquest, after which he stripped down to his loincloth in warlike fashion and showed the crowd the shrunken head of the Inca killed in 1537. The gesture was clearly meant to glorify his role in the conquest and to offend the present Inca, causing that four of them attacked him and a fracas erupted. When the brawl was broken up, the teniente de corregidor Juan Luis de Monjaraz reprimanded Chilche for the scandal and confiscated the head.\\n\\nIn 1558, Sayri Túpac was installed as new kuraka of Yucay as a consequence of political changes in the Spanish crown, but he died suddenly, after which Chilche was accused of poisoning him to recover his domains. He spent one year in prison between trials, but was freed as no evidence of the crime was found, although Garcilaso and Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala believed he was guilty. Chilche then forced the late Sayri's favorite concubine, Inés Coya, to marry him. This chapter of his life was followed by a last military tenure against the rebel Túpac Amaru as captain general of the Indian auxiliaries. Chilche died in 1586, after which his son Hernando Guatanaula, the first of eight siblings, inherited Yucay.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nCategory:1497 births\\nCategory:1586 deaths\\nCategory:Inca Empire people\\nCategory:Spanish Indian auxiliaries\",\n"," 'Mário Augusto Caetano João de Sousa (born 24 November 1978) is an Angolan professor, economist, writer, and politician.

It contains the single species Glyphopsis aurantiodisca, a bark-dwelling crustose lichen found in New Caledonia. Both the genus and species were described as new to science in 2014 by the Dutch lichenologist André Aptroot.\\n\\nDescription\\n\\nGlyphopsis aurantiodisca has a crustose (crust-like) thallus, which is white and adheres closely to the bark of trees. The thallus is thin, cracked, and lacks a protective outer layer (), giving it a dull appearance. It often contains hyaline (colourless) crystals that can fall out, leaving angular holes in the surface. The internal tissue (medulla) is white, and no  (a distinct boundary layer) is present. The lichen hosts  algae, a type of green algae that forms a symbiotic relationship with the fungus.\\n\\nThe ascomata (fruiting bodies) are  (directly attached to the  without a stalk) and have a broad base. These structures are typically round to irregularly shaped, sometimes branching slightly, and are often grouped together in -like (supportive tissue) formations. The ascomata measure between 0.5 and 1.4\\xa0mm in diameter and feature a bright orange,  (powdery)  that is exposed. The margins of the ascomata are raised above the disc and are of the same white colour as the thallus, measuring around 0.2\\xa0mm wide.\\n\\nThe outer layer of the ascomata () is hyaline and contains large, angular crystals, with the hyphae (fungal filaments) also incrusted with small hyaline crystals. The underlying tissue () is yellowish and measures about 100–155\\xa0μm in height. The surrounding tissue () is thin and contains orange pigment, while the internal tissue () is not filled with granular material () but shows streaks of orange pigment and contains filaments that intertwine (anastomose).\\n\\nThe asci, which are spore-producing sacs, are broadly  (club-shaped) and contain eight  each. These ascospores are hyaline, somewhat clavate in shape, and typically have 5 to 7 transverse septa (dividing partitions) with 1 to 4 longitudinal septa. They measure 18–21 by 7–8.5\\xa0μm.\\n\\nChemically, the thallus reacts to ultraviolet light with a white fluorescence and contains divaricatic acid and zeorin, two lichen products identified through thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The ascomata also contain two anthraquinones, pigments responsible for the bright orange colour, although these compounds do not appear on TLC tests.\\n\\nHabitat and distribution\\n\\nGlyphopsis aurantiodisca is found exclusively in New Caledonia, where it inhabits the bark of trees in scrub forests. The species has been recorded from the Plaine des Lacs region, specifically along the  at an elevation of about . At the time of its original publication, this lichen was known to occur only from this location, making it endemic to the New Caledonia region.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nCategory:Arthoniomycetes\\nCategory:Arthoniomycetes genera\\nCategory:Lichen genera\\nCategory:Taxa described in 2014\\nCategory:Taxa named by André Aptroot',\n"," 'Chitsen Aphaiwong () or formerly Mew Aphaiwong ( แสวง อภัยวงศ์ (พ.ศ. ๒๔๕๓-๒๕๑๕). พูนพิศ อมาตรยกุล (เรียบเรียงจาก คำให้สัมภาษณ์ของ นิภา อภัยวงศ์.).

On 6 April 2018, he announced his resignation to run to be governor of the state of Rio Grande do Norte that year.\\n\\n Biography \\nAlves graduated with a law degree from Universidade Santa Úrsula, though he never became a lawyer because he never had registered with the Order of Attorneys of Brazil (OAB). Coming from a politically prominent family, he is the son of former Natal mayor Agnelo Alves, who had been removed from office during the Brazilian military dictatorship due to his family's opposition to the regime. Carlos Eduardo Alves later entered into politics in Natal and became a state deputy in 1986. His uncles were ex-governor of Rio Grande do Norte , through whom Henrique Eduardo Alves is his cousin, and former senator Garibaldi Alves, through whom Garibaldi Alves Filho is also his cousin.\\n\\nIn 2000, he was elected vice-mayor of Natal, having assumed the mayoralty in 2002 after the resignation of then-mayor Wilma de Faria, to run for governor. He was reelected in his own right in 2004.\\n\\nAfter ending his mandate, Alves was caught in scandals involving the expiration of eight tons of medicine that were stored by his administration that were later discarded.\\n\\nIn 2010, he ran for governor of Rio Grande do Norte as part of the Democratic Labour Party (PDT), receiving third place with 160,828 votes (10.37%) and not advancing to the second round.

The murders, known as \"The Valentine\\'s Day Murders\", have to this day never been solved. Police have permanently reopened the investigation since 2011, and have requested in recent years for the public to come forward with any and all needed information.\\n\\nVictims\\nPatricia Ann Mann, the youngest of four children, was a nursing student from Sanford, doing her residential training at Watts Hospital in Durham. Jesse Allen McBane was a North Carolina State University athletic student from Pittsboro in his freshman year. McBane\\'s class voted him \"Most Likely to Succeed\". The couple started dating in high school, eventually getting engaged in the weeks before the murders.\\n\\nMurder\\nOn February 12, 1971, Mann and McBane left a Valentine\\'s Day dance they attended together at Watts Hospital. Mann, accompanied by McBane, signed out of her dorm and planned to return by the 1am curfew. Their families and Mann\\'s roommates went to police when they didn\\'t return that night. On February 16, McBane\\'s friend found his brother Marty\\'s car the couple left in at a lover\\'s lane at Wayside Place. The car was locked, and it appeared to be wiped of fingerprints. Two coats and Mann\\'s folded pantyhose were found inside the car.\\n\\nOn February 24, a surveyor in Duke Woods, three miles away from the lane, found Mann and McBane dead, tied to a tree and covered in leaves and debris. Their causes of death were determined to be asphyxiation, from ropes, which were even then still tied to both of them, being repeatedly tightened and released around each of their necks. Mud on their shoes indicated they were alive for the extent of the violence, which was estimated to have lasted some hours before the couple died. Examinations also revealed that had multiple stab wounds to their chests, which were postmortem, and Mann\\'s liver was ruptured from what was determined to be a punch to her stomach.\\n\\nInvestigation and Legacy\\nSgt. Tim Bowers of the Durham Police Department was first assigned the investigation, shortly after his promotion. He solicited New York criminal psychologist Dr. James Brussel to create a profile of the killer. Multiple agencies became involved in the case, including the Orange County Sheriff\\'s Office, Durham Sheriff\\'s Office, The North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, and the North Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles. There\\'s an agreement the killer(s) met Mann and McBane before the murders, let alone the killings were planned and the killer was familiar with the location. The case went cold in part to difficulties and apprehension between different departments\\' and offices\\' investigations, as well as struggles to narrow in on suspects.\\n\\nFor a while after that, locals avoided the woods where Mann and McBane were found, preventing people they knew from going into the woods, such as their children when they wanted to play, out of the fear they would also be harmed. In the following year of 1972, as would later be publicized, another couple was attacked by a gunman who tried to kidnap them Duke Forest by forcing them into the trunk of his car. The man fought the attacker, who pistol-whipped him violently enough the victim was left with lasting nerve damage. The couple nevertheless escaped, and the gunman fled. The case was assigned to a now-retired State Bureau agent, who would provide the case file and other evidence to later investigations, including a composite sketch of the suspect.  Then in 1995, anonymous called confessed to the murders to Mann\\'s and McBane\\'s families. The call was traced to have been placed a mile from where the couple was found dead.\\n\\nIn 2011, Mann\\'s cousin, Carolyn Spivey, who married McBane\\'s best friend David by then, called to ask if there were any updates. This was around the same time Major Tim Horne of the Orange County Sheriff\\'s Office found discarded evidence when Sheriff Lindy Pendergrass was planning a renovation at the local jail. The case has since been reopened, Horne and Sheriff\\'s Office Investigator Dawn Hunter acting as the leading investigators of the case. Horne ensured his involvement by extending his retirement to the end of 2018 to provide attention and effort to the investigation. The department tried to use M-VAC System technology, having one of only a hundred machines in existence and forty in the nation alone, to collect DNA from the ropes and other evidence. No viable samples for testing against suspects were recovered. Nevertheless, the investigators have gotten calls offering other agencies\\' assistance and other technology for evidence collection, including from the Texas Rangers, Homeland Security, and law enforcement in the Netherlands and Australia.\\n\\nIn 2018, writer and filmmaker Eryk Pruitt and journalist Drew Adamack collaborated to release the podcast The Long Dance on June 30, which focuses on the lives of Mann and McBane, as well as the timelines and investigations surrounding their murders. Horne communicated with Pruitt and Adamack within the year and a half the podcast was being developed, and not only shared each other information the other side was missing, but they also focused in on the same suspects. Pruitt has also released a thriller novel, Something Bad Wrong, which is a fictionalized story inspired by the murders of Mann and McBane, as well as Pruitt\\'s experiences with consulting with law enforcement on the case and collaborating with the investigation.\\n\\nA doctor employed at Watts Hospital at the time of the murders, whose name has not been released, has been recently confirmed to be considered a person of interest, the only living out of three prime suspects. His attorney spoke for him in his decline to provide a DNA sample. No arrests have yet been made. Police in Orange County Sheriff\\'s Office are still investigating the case and are asking the public for assistance.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nCategory:1971 murders in the United States\\nCategory:Murder in North Carolina\\nCategory:Unsolved murders in the United States\\nCategory:Torture in the United States',\n"," \"The women's 100 metres T11 event at the 2024 Summer Paralympics in Paris, will take place between 2 and 3 September 2024.\\n\\n Records \\nPrior to the competition, the existing records were as follows:\\n\\n Area Time Athlete Location Date Africa 12.39    Lahja Ishitile   Kobe  America 11.83    Jerusa Geber dos Santos   São Paulo  Asia 11.91    Zhou Guohua   Nottwil  Europe 11.91    Libby Clegg   Rio de Janeiro  Oceania 14.42    Karlee Symonds   South Australia \\n\\n Results \\n Round 1 \\n4 heats start on 2 September 2024 with the first in each heat (Q) and the next 4 fastest (q) advance to the semi-finals.\\n Heat 1 \\n Rank Lane Athlete Nation Time Notes 1 5 Lorena Spoladore  12.11 ,  2 1 Lahja Ishitile  12.12 ,  3 3 Asila Mirzayorova  13.08  4 7 Rosario Coppola  14.05   Source: Wind: +0.7 m/s \\n\\n Heat 2 \\n Rank Lane Athlete Nation Time Notes 1 3 Jerusa Geber dos Santos  12.57  2 5 Alba García Falagán  12.90  3 7 Arjola Dedaj  13.13 Source: Wind: +0.5 m/s \\n\\n Heat 3 \\n Rank Lane Athlete Nation Time Notes 1 5 Zhou Guohau  12.28 ,  2 3 Juliana Moko  12.51 ,  3 7 Jhulia Dos Santos  12.56   1 Na Brinbamde Domingas    Source: Wind: +0.1 m/s \\n\\n Heat 4 \\n Rank Lane Athlete Nation Time Notes 1 7 Liu Cuiqing  12.15  2 3 Linda Patricia Pérez López  12.24 ,  3 5 Fathimath Ibrahim  17.10     1 Delya Boulaghlem    Source: Wind: -0.3 m/s \\n\\nSemi-finals\\nFirst in each heat (Q) and the next 2 fastest (q) advance to the Final.\\n Heat 1 \\n Rank Lane Athlete Nation Time Notes 1 5 Lorena Spoladore  12.07 ,  2 7 Lahja Ishitile  12.19  3 3 Zhou Guohau  12.25  4 1 Juliana Moko  12.56  Source: Wind: 0.0 m/s \\n\\n Heat 2 \\n Rank Lane Athlete Nation Time Notes 1 3 Jerusa Geber dos Santos  11.80 ,  2 5 Liu Cuiqing  12.06  3 7 Linda Patricia Pérez López  12.19 ,  4 1 Jhulia Dos Santos  12.58  Source: Wind: +0.2 m/s \\n\\nFinal\\nThe final will take place on 3 September 2024:\\n Rank Lane Athlete Nation Time Notes  3 Jerusa Geber dos Santos  11.83   7 Liu Cuiqing  12.04   5 Lorena Spoladore  12.14  4 1 Linda Patricia Pérez López  12.27  Source: Wind: -0.1 m/s \\n\\nReferences\\n\\nWomen's 100 metres T11\\nCategory:Women's events at the 2024 Summer Paralympics\\nCategory:2024 in women's athletics\",\n"," 'The Santa Clara Beltway is a ring road encircling the city of Santa Clara, Cuba.

The title of the magazine comes from the 1963 surf rock instrumental hit, \"Pipeline\" by The Chantays.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nThe Pipeline Instrumental Review has been published quarterly since 1989 and edited by Alan Taylor and Dave Burke. It reviews the latest instrumental releases and others related to the genre. The magazine also features interviews with musicians and performers such as with Hank Marvin when he was on tour in 1997 for example. The Tornados were featured in 1996 who were described by the magazine as \"the only UK instrumental group to provide a serious chart challenge to The Shadows\". The Lively Ones, whose music was featured in Quentin Tarantino\\'s 1994 film Pulp Fiction, were also interviewed in 1997 and their discography was showcased, which was a regular part of Pipeline\\'\\'\\'s features of the bands they interviewed. The story of The Packabeats was featured in 1997 who provided the theme tune to the 1962 film, The Traitors. The Ventures, who having sold over 100 million, are the biggest selling instrumental band of all time, were given extensive coverage by Pipeline magazine from 1990 to 2009. Joe Moretti was interviewed by Pipeline\\'\\' magazine in 2002 and he gave details about the recording of the number 1 hit \"Shakin\\' All Over\" on which he played guitar for the band Johnny Kidd & the Pirates in 1960.\\n\\nConvention\\n\\nEach year from 1993 to 2014 the magazine held the Pipeline Instrumental Rock Convention at venues in London and Hertfordshire. From 1995 onward the Conventions were filmed by Intec Services and made available commercially on VHS but from 2006 all, including from 1995 onward, were made available in superior quality on DVD.

Starring Teresa Mo, Ronald Cheng, Wong You-nam, Jennifer Yu, Edan Lui, Yeung Wai Lun, Lau Kong, and Bonnie Wong, the film revolves around a group of apartment residents trying to dispose of a mysterious corpse that has appeared on their floor to prevent their homes from becoming stigmatized properties and losing value.\\n\\nThe screenplay began development in March 2019 and was greenlit in October 2021, with Ho Cheuk Tin joining the project that same year, marking his second feature film after The Sparring Partner (2022). Filming commenced in May 2022 and wrapped in June, primarily taking place in Tai Wai, Sha Tin District.\\n\\nThe film had its world premiere as the closing film of the 18th Osaka Film Festival on 15 March 2023, followed by a theatrical release in Hong Kong on 4 April. It received two nominations in the 42nd Hong Kong Film Awards, with Jiro Lee nominated for Best Supporting Actor.\\n\\n Synopsis \\nMing returns to his mother-in-law Meghan\\'s apartment 14A in high-end private estate Seaside Heights after work, where he lives with his wife Yana and brother-in-law Kingston. Later that night, after Ming takes out the garbage, he discovers a male body lying at the door of their apartment. Nervously, he alerts everyone inside.\\n\\nWithout thoroughly checking whether the man is dead, Ming suggests calling the police, but Meghan immediately rejects this option, fearing their apartment will become stigmatized property, significantly losing value and complicating their already debt-ridden lives. She proposes moving the corpse to their neighboring apartment 14B, and the four residents of 14A push the body next door with mops to avoid leaving any traces. However, they accidentally make noise, alerting the 14B residents, an elderly couple named Boron and Betty. Boron sees the 14A residents moving the corpse through the peephole and immediately opens the door to confront them. Concerned that their apartment\\'s devaluation will affect their planned migration and retirement savings, the old couple bursts into an argument with them. Soon, they all agree to move the corpse to 14C, where Mary, a taciturn woman rumored to be associated with sorcery, lives and might know how to handle the situation. When they move the corpse to her door, it breaks open, and a pet dog runs out, revealing that her strange behavior is due to her secretly keeping a pet. Meghan immediately accuses the dog of having bitten the man to death, but Mary denies it, claiming that the dog is a Buddhist, and such an accusation of it taking a life could prevent it from reincarnating.\\n\\nA man steps out of the elevator, introducing himself as Bear, who lives in 14D. Everyone then falsely claims they have seen a corpse lying outside of his apartment, insisting it belongs to him. Arguments ensue, with threats to call the police, but none actually take action. Then, a man walks out of 14D, alerted by the loud commotion, and introduces himself as Bear\\'s son Messi. To ease the hostility, Meghan brings up the public housing estate next to Seaside Heights known for suicides. Everyone, except Messi, agrees to move the corpse there since it is a public estate and will not affect property prices. As Ming, Kingston, Boron, and Bear move the corpse downstairs, they encounter their apartment\\'s security guard Lee. They try but fail to fool him, and after he discovers the body, they subdue him and lock him up in 14D under the reluctant supervision of Messi. Realizing that all exits of the building have CCTV, they decide to drop the corpse down the garbage chute and retrieve it from the refuse chamber. However, a group of workers cleans the pipe, forcing them to retrieve the body and find an alternative plan. Their actions catch the attention of a girl smoking nearby, who introduces herself as Sue, a resident of 13A. She is getting married the next day and doesn\\'t want any bad luck in the building, so she offers her help.\\n\\nLee manages to escape while luring Messi to drink beer and gets drunk. He pursues the residents of the 14th floor, who are moving the corpse to the rooftop, using a suspended working platform to transport it out of the building on Sue\\'s advice. Boron kicks Lee down the stairs, but he then suffers a heart attack and dies. The platform jams when it reaches the 14th floor, and everyone starts making excuses to stall the corpse from entering their home.\\n\\nWith no other options, they seek Sue\\'s help again. She offers to smuggle the corpse under her bridal gown during her tea ceremony the next day. Although the residents of the 14th floor manage to sneak past Sue\\'s relatives and friends, they are blocked again by Lee on the road. Messi hands Lee a red envelope, and he happily moves out of the way. They bury the corpse on a nearby hill. However, the corpse is actually still alive and has only been stung by a bee. Hearing his moans as he recovers, the residents begin to dig him out of the grave.\\n\\n Cast \\n Teresa Mo as Meghan So, a materialistic matriarch and resident of 14A\\n Ronald Cheng as Bear Cheung, a grumpy taxi driver and resident of 14D\\n Wong You-nam as Ming To, the underemployed husband of Yana who resides in his mother-in-law\\'s 14A\\n Jennifer Yu as Yana Chung, Ming\\'s wife and resident of 14A\\n Edan Lui as Messi Cheung, a football coach and the son of Bear who resides in 14D\\n Yeung Wai Lun as Kingston Chung, the autistic son of Meghan and Yana\\'s brother who resides in 14A\\n Lau Kong as Boron Chan, a retired teacher and resident of 14B\\n Bonnie Wong as Betty Chan, Boron\\'s wife and a resident of 14B\\n\\nAlso appearing in the film are Hanna Chan as Sue Yu, a soon-to-be-married resident of 13A who offered help to the 14th floor residents; Hang Sang Poon as Sue\\'s father; Jiro Lee as S.G.

Fruit Chan was slated to cameo as a garage owner, but his scenes were cut from the final version.\\n\\n Production \\n Development \\nWriter Kong Ho Yan was approached by producer Amy Chin, with whom he had previously collaborated on The Midnight After (2014) and the unreleased Goodbye UFO, to produce a comedy film. Kong presented several ideas, including one centered on the Hong Kong property market that follows a group of residents driven to madness by inflated property prices. The duo developed the screenplay from March 2019 and completed it by the end of that year. Chin then began searching for suitable directors and was advised by filmmaker Philip Yung and actor Yeung Wai Lun to consider Ho Cheuk Tin, who had worked with them on the then-unreleased The Sparring Partner (2022). Ho accepted the invitation in 2021, despite The Sparring Partner being a dark thriller that contrasts with the comedic tone of Over My Dead Body, marking his second feature film. He also cited The Seventh Seal (1957) and Shanghai, Shanghai (1990) as significant influences on the film. The main cast was handpicked by Chin, and potential cameos began to be arranged once the cast was finalized. In October 2021, the film was greenlit and received funding from the Film Development Fund of the Hong Kong Film Development Council, with Yeung Wai Lun and boy group Mirror member Ian Chan  reported to be part of the main cast. Chan later denied being cast on Telegram. The film has a total production budget of 18.8 million HKD, with the Development Fund consisting of 7.6 million HKD. In April 2022, Teresa Mo, Ronald Cheng, and another Mirror member Edan Lui were announced as the main cast. Mo, who resided in Canada, returned to Hong Kong for filming earlier in January. In May, it was announced that the film would be jointly produced by One Cool Film Production, 852 Films, and Icon Group, with Josie Ho attached as a producer, and Jer Lau, Wong You-nam, Jennifer Yu, Hanna Chan, Lau Kong, and Bonnie Wong revealed to star. A teaser poster and release date were announced in January 2023, while the official trailer was released in March.\\n\\n Filming \\nPrincipal photography began on 21 May 2022, with the first day of filming focused on a wedding scene. Approximately two-thirds of the film was shot in a studio, while most of the location shooting took place in Tai Wai, Sha Tin District. Director Ho Cheuk Tin chose to set the film in Tai Wai, as it is a new town and logical to have a new housing estate as the setting, with the town only bisected by the canals of Shing Mun River instead of being situated near the sea, which serves as a sarcastic irony to the name of the housing estate, \"Seaside Heights\", featured in the film. Filming wrapped up on 15 June.\\n\\n Music \\nThe film\\'s theme song \"Salted Fish Game\" was composed by Tsui Chin Hung, with lyrics by Wyman Wong and performed by Jer Lau. Director Ho Cheuk Tin deemed Lau\\'s role, which was a cameo appearance in the film, too minor, so he also invited him to perform the theme song.\\n\\n Release \\nOver My Dead Body had its world premiere as the closing film of the 18th Osaka Film Festival on 15 March 2023, followed by a theatrical release on 4 April in Hong Kong. The film was also showcased at the 25th Taipei Film Festival on 6 July.\\n\\n Reception \\n Box office \\nOver My Dead Body grossed over 5.83 HKD during Easter, and reached 10 million in its opening weekend. The film received 17 million in its second week, and accumulated over 20 million by its third week on 28 April, making it the second highest-grossing Hong Kong film of 2023 at that time. As of mid-May, the film\\'s box office total stood at over 30 million.\\n\\n Critical response \\nEdmund Lee of South China Morning Post gave Over My Dead Body 3.5/5 stars, praising director Ho Cheuk Tin\\'s raw talent and confidence in crafting a conceptually adventurous and aesthetically considered comedy-drama out of an unlikely but clever premise revolving around a political pun and the absurdities of Hong Kong\\'s inflated property market. Keith Ho, writing for HK01, praised the film as a surprising black comedy filled with incisive absurdity, acknowledging the relevant themes, sharp dialogue, and the excellent direction and performances, which perfectly reflect the beauty and tragedy that Hong Kong people face in dealing with the absurdities of the real estate market. Jonathan Hung, in his review for am730, praised the film as a hilarious yet poignant black comedy that showcases the young director\\'s bold and insightful approach to tackling the absurdities of Hong Kong society, with Hung noting the standout performances, particularly from actors Jiro Lee and Kenneth Cheung in minor roles, as well as the exceptionally written script and applaudable humour.\\n\\nLeaf Arbuthnot of The Guardian gave the film 2/5 stars and offered a rather negative review, criticizing the film\\'s frustrating attempt at delivering goofy comedy, which falls short with jokes that are unfunny, characters that are overly stereotypical, and an overall inane feeling, despite its promising premise about the madness of the Hong Kong property market. Kwok Ching-yin of Esquire focused on the auteur approach of the filmmaker, noting the similarity between this film and Ho Cheuk Tin\\'s previous entry The Sparring Partner in their exploration of generational and political conflict in Hong Kong through metaphors, introspection scenes, and word puns, but whereas The Sparring Partner had a tragic ending, Over My Dead Body offered a more optimistic resolution where the generations reconciled.\\n\\nAwards and nominations\\n Year Award Category Nominee Result  Ref.202442nd Hong Kong Film Awards Best Supporting Actor Jiro Lee  Best Costume Make Up Design Stephanie Wong \\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n\\nCategory:2023 films\\nCategory:2023 black comedy films\\nCategory:Hong Kong black comedy films\\nCategory:2020s Hong Kong films\\nCategory:2020s Cantonese-language films\\nCategory:Films set in Hong Kong\\nCategory:Films shot in Hong Kong',\n"," \"thumb|right|Erwin Biswanger in Metropolis (1927)\\nErwin Paul Biswanger (26 November 1896 in Berlin – 28 October 1944 in Berlin) was a German actor and screenwriter most famous for his role as Georgy in Metropolis (1927).\\n\\nLife and work\\nLittle is known about Biswanger's life and career.

He served in the cabinet of the State of East Indonesia as minister of social affairs and minister of information in 1947. He was also active in the Indonesian nationalist movement, having been a member of various youth organizations. He later became a lecturer at Hasanuddin University.\\n\\n Early life and career \\nGodlief Rudolf Pantouw was born in Manado, a city in present-day North Sulawesi, on 30 October 1910. He was active in the  youth organization and was one of its delegates to the second Youth Congress held on 27–28 October 1928. Pantouw was also active in the  association. During the 1930s, he worked as a teacher at the Pergoeroean Rakjat-School () in Makassar. However, he was suspended and later banned from teaching by the Dutch East Indies government for having disturbed security and order. In 1938, he stood for a seat in the Manado Gemeenteraad (municipal council).\\n\\n Independence struggle \\n\\nPantouw joined another organization in Makassar, Syukai Gi In, before it changed its name to Sumburan Darah Rakyat (Sudara, ) following the surrender of Japan and the proclamation of Indonesian independence. Despite being active in organizations like Sudara and the People\\'s Sovereignty Party, Pantouw decided to collaborate with the Dutch after realizing an inability to achieve much with the former. He joined the first cabinet of the Dutch-backed State of East Indonesia (Negara Indonesia Timur, NIT) in 1947, becoming minister of information under Prime Minister Nadjamuddin Daeng Malewa, a fellow nationalist.\\n\\nAs a minister, Pantouw was mainly concerned with tackling the social problems facing the Indonesian people. He was aware of the NIT\\'s reputation as a Dutch puppet state, but was determined to use the state as a tool to push the Dutch into abandoning colonialism. He argued that \"it was impossible for the newly proclaimed Republic of Indonesia — which had no power, no army, and no weapons in this part of the country — to fight the Dutch effectively\" therefore joining the NIT was essential to advance the cause of Indonesian independence given the political conditions at the time. The revolution eventually came to an end in 1949, but nationalists continued their goal of disbanding the NIT and re-establishing a unitary state. The Makassar Uprising accelerated reunification talks and the NIT was dissolved into the republic in 1950.\\n\\n Later career \\nPantouw became a lecturer at the Djakarta Journalist Academy in the 1950s, together with Parada Harahap and Sitor Situmorang. During the 1960s, he taught at the newly created College of Press and Publication, a private college for journalistic education, which was merged into Hasanuddin University. Thereafter, he served as head of the university\\'s journalism study program.\\n\\n Notes \\n\\n References \\n\\nCategory:1910 births\\nCategory:Minahasa people\\nCategory:Politicians from the State of East Indonesia\\nCategory:People of the Indonesian National Revolution\\nCategory:People from North Sulawesi']"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":13}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["trainer = MonosemanticityTrainer(model, optimizer=optimizer, extractor=extractor_mock, train_config=trainer_config)\n","metrics = trainer.train(dataloader)\n","metrics"],"metadata":{"id":"Iw9Hu0qXEeac","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1730860350549,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":4315,"user":{"displayName":"Einstein Oyewole","userId":"13069745930786112792"}},"outputId":"a0692926-aa7a-4941-fae3-2cd3b10bbd77"},"id":"Iw9Hu0qXEeac","execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["INFO:src.trainer:Saving model to: /content/drive/MyDrive/School/DS-GA 1011/capstone/tests/model.pkl\n","  0%|          | 0/10 [00:00<?, ?it/s]INFO:src.trainer:\n","Epoch 1/10\n","DEBUG:src.trainer:Training epoch\n"," 10%|█         | 1/10 [00:00<00:04,  2.19it/s]INFO:src.trainer:\n","Epoch 2/10\n","DEBUG:src.trainer:Training epoch\n"," 20%|██        | 2/10 [00:00<00:03,  2.33it/s]INFO:src.trainer:\n","Epoch 3/10\n","DEBUG:src.trainer:Training epoch\n"," 30%|███       | 3/10 [00:01<00:03,  2.29it/s]INFO:src.trainer:\n","Epoch 4/10\n","DEBUG:src.trainer:Training epoch\n"," 40%|████      | 4/10 [00:01<00:02,  2.37it/s]INFO:src.trainer:\n","Epoch 5/10\n","DEBUG:src.trainer:Training epoch\n"," 50%|█████     | 5/10 [00:02<00:02,  2.38it/s]INFO:src.trainer:\n","Epoch 6/10\n","DEBUG:src.trainer:Training epoch\n"," 60%|██████    | 6/10 [00:02<00:01,  2.22it/s]INFO:src.trainer:\n","Epoch 7/10\n","DEBUG:src.trainer:Training epoch\n"," 70%|███████   | 7/10 [00:03<00:01,  2.03it/s]INFO:src.trainer:\n","Epoch 8/10\n","DEBUG:src.trainer:Training epoch\n"," 80%|████████  | 8/10 [00:03<00:00,  2.15it/s]INFO:src.trainer:\n","Epoch 9/10\n","DEBUG:src.trainer:Training epoch\n"," 90%|█████████ | 9/10 [00:04<00:00,  2.26it/s]INFO:src.trainer:\n","Epoch 10/10\n","DEBUG:src.trainer:Training epoch\n","100%|██████████| 10/10 [00:04<00:00,  2.26it/s]\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["{'train_loss': [0.15219615399837494,\n","  0.0948820412158966,\n","  0.06523624807596207,\n","  0.05233236774802208,\n","  0.04733245447278023,\n","  0.045296359807252884,\n","  0.04418759047985077,\n","  0.043347276747226715,\n","  0.04258923605084419,\n","  0.04186037927865982],\n"," 'train_mse_loss': [0.11173000186681747,\n","  0.05195005238056183,\n","  0.02085583470761776,\n","  0.007387909572571516,\n","  0.0024646653328090906,\n","  0.0008908059680834413,\n","  0.0004300286527723074,\n","  0.00030132546089589596,\n","  0.00026368448743596673,\n","  0.00024866434978321195],\n"," 'train_l1_regularization': [0.04046614095568657,\n","  0.04293198883533478,\n","  0.044380418956279755,\n","  0.04494445398449898,\n","  0.04486778751015663,\n","  0.04440555348992348,\n","  0.04375755786895752,\n","  0.043045952916145325,\n","  0.04232555255293846,\n","  0.04161171242594719]}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":14}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["plot_training_metrics(metrics, 'test.png')"],"metadata":{"id":"u_MYEU18S_qr","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1730860351267,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":723,"user":{"displayName":"Einstein Oyewole","userId":"13069745930786112792"}}},"id":"u_MYEU18S_qr","execution_count":15,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":2},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython2","version":"2.7.6"},"colab":{"provenance":[],"gpuType":"T4"},"accelerator":"GPU"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
