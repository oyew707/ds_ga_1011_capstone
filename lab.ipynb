       "['The Golden Road: How Ancient India Transformed the World is a 2024 history book by William Dalrymple. It discusses the ways in which India\\'s ideas and influences spread throughout and shaped Eurasia.\\n\\n Overview \\nThe book argues that the primary route connecting Eurasia from 250 BC to 1200 AD was a route going through India referred to in the book as the \"Golden Road\"; this route facilitated an Indian sphere of influence referred to as the Indosphere.\\n\\nIndia\\'s outward influence began with the west coast of India interacting with the outside world as far west as the Roman Empire; the fall of Rome in the 5th and 6th centuries then forced Indian traders to turn their attention eastward, resulting in significant influence upon Southeast Asia. By the 7th century, Buddhism had penetrated China, with the reign of Wu Zetian resulting in a brief Indianization of the royal court and a general explosion of learning from India. And by the 13th century, Indian mathematical and astronomical ideas had gone through the Arab world and reached Europe, but in the same century, conquests put an end to the heretofore peaceful expansion of Indian influence. Mongol conquests in Eurasia ended India\\'s centrality by paving the way for the Silk Road, giving China greater prominence as it thus gained access to the Mediterranean, while Muslim armies temporarily interrupted trade routes to India\\'s west and took over North India.\\n\\nDalrymple was inspired to write the book after a visit to Angkor Wat, the largest Hindu temple in the world. He spent five years travelling throughout the Middle East, India and Southeast Asia to do research for the book.\\n\\n See also \\n\\n Indo-Mediterranean\\n\\n References \\n\\n Further reading \\n\\n William Dalrymple Explains | The ancient history behind the maritime trade route between India and Europe\\n\\nCategory:2024 non-fiction books\\nCategory:Books by William Dalrymple\\nCategory:History books about India\\nCategory:Bloomsbury Publishing books',\n",

       " \"The 1902 eruption of Santa María was one of the largest eruptions of the 20th century, measuring a six on the volcanic explosivity index of eight. The main eruption began on 24 October 1902 and lasted no more than 20 hours. Prior to its catastrophic eruption, Santa María had no record of an eruption. The eruption killed between 5,000 and 8,700 people. Immediate knowledge about the eruption was suppressed by President Manuel Estrada Cabrera due to the occurrence of a propaganda festival at around the same time of the eruption. Aid did not reach the affected areas immediately and only arrived in December.\\n\\nBackground\\nThe formation of Santa María occurred approximately 30,000 years BP, constructing the present cone to a volume of . It comprise predominantly of basaltic andesites and pyriclastic material. It is part of a large volcanic belt that straddles the Pacific coast of Middle America. Prior to the 1902 eruption, there were no historical records of activity on the volcano. It was previously considered extinct.\\n\\nIn early 1902, Guatemala was affected by a series of damaging earthquakes; the first in this sequence occurring on 18 January. This event affected San Martín and the country's Pacific coastal region. Ouezaltenango and San Marcos were razed during the 18 April earthquake, which was also the largest of the sequence and killing 1,000 people. This event caused major damage to buildings and was felt in other countries. The epicenter of the April shock was thought to be near Santa María. A series of local earthquakes occurring with high frequency was felt within the volcano's vicinity for six weeks. Another major shock occurred on 23 September that was felt as far as Mexico.\\n\\nEruption\\n220px|thumb|right|Satellite view of Santa Maria with the large scarp that formed during the eruption\\nOn 24 October, slight earthquakes were perceived. Santa María began discharging steam in the afternoon, before rumbling noises were heard within its vicinity at 17:00. In San Felipe, the sound was described by people as either reminiscent of a waterfall or large boiler. These sounds emanated from the direction of the volcano and persisted for 30 minutes. At about the same period, people in Quezaltenango began to report a dark cloud from the volcano. As the evening progressed, a white sand-like substance began showering and blanketing the area, discoloring the landscape with its witish color.\\n\\nAt 18:15, ash particles were reported in Finca Helvetia, about  west of the volcano. By 20:00, the volcano produced a large eruption column accompanied by lightning flashes. This column took on cauliflower-like shapes. Large lithics began to rain down the volcano's southern flanks at 01:00 of 25 October, signifying that the eruption had entered its plinian stage. Pea-sized lapilli ash began to fall in Quezaltenago at 03:00. Meanwhile, in Finca Helvetia, pumice measuring  and between  began to rain onto the village at 03:00. The initial fallout was cold before hot pumice was introduced. The material in this fallout later included hot, fist-sized rocks and lava bombs. By 11:00, the eruption had reached its climax. The eruption persisted into the night, though its intensity gradually decreased. The main eruption ended before the morning of 26 October.\\n\\nBlasts were heard in Costa Rica, some  southeast of the volcano. In Oaxaca and Belize, explosions could be heard. The eruption continued to shake windows in Cobán until mid-day and its residents detected a sulfrous smell. The captain of the S.S. Newport used her sextant to measure the height of the eruption column and placed his estimation at . Another sailor measured the column at  which has been deemed errorneous. The ash fallout made its way into Motozintla in Mexico, some  northwest of the volcano, at 06:00. The ash traveled further into the country and reached Mexico City. The initial plinian eruption ceased after 18 to 20 hours before another eruptive phase initiated in the early hours of 26 October. This new activity was phreatomagmatic and accompanied by steam eruptions. Light steam explosions continued to occur in 1903. Earthquake activity was frequent and residents could detect the stench of hydrogen sulphide.\\n\\nDuring the course of the eruption, it generated a dense-rock equivalent (DRE) volume of  of magma. The dacite measured in DRE was estimated at . The tephra volume was estimated at 2.0 cubic meters. Unlike most large eruptions of its kind, Santa María's plinian column did not collapse. The eruption also did not create a caldera although it expelled a large volume of magma. This was probably attributed to a deep-than-usual location for its magma chamber, which, during the 1902 eruption, was not entirely emptied. The Santiaguito lava dome which formed in 1922 had a nearly identical lava composition with the lava that erupted in 1902. \\n\\nAlthough a caldera did not form, a new, oval-shaped crater had emerged. Karl Sapper reported that three explorers visited the crater in late November. The explorers described a crater with an east-west axis of  and was  at its widest base diameter. It also extended to a depth of . The crater floor hosted six vents; the largest was circular and  across, and situated in the center of the crater. The remaining vents were distributed along the edge of the crater and were constantly emmitting steam. The second largest of these vents was actively spewing debris some  into the air. A section of the volcano's flank was destroyed, exposing steep cliffs and revealing layers of lava flows and ash deposits extending  high. This major scarp nearly reached the summit of the volcano. Large pieces of rocks were observed falling and accumulating at the bottom of the scarp in a  debris cone. They also estimated the crater wall's slope to be 60 degrees.\\n\\nImpact\\n200px|thumb|The explosion crater photographed in 1903 with Chicabal in the background\\nAll trees and shrubs within a  by  area that stretched halfway towards the Pacific were stripped of its leaves and severely damaged by the rushing volcanic debris. Many trees were entirely uprooted, snapped at their branches; many others were also split by lightning. All vegetation was destroyed within a  reach of the crater. Within a month of the eruption, new leaves began to sprout from undamaged tree branches. Coffee plants also began producing new branches as their existing ones were torn away by the eruption. Up to  of ash covered the ground within the immediate vicinity of the explosion crater.\\n\\nPortions of coffee plantations in Xolhuitz, Costa Cuca, Chuva, Progreso and Tumbador were devastated and unrestored. The total losses for coffee was placed at over 300 thousand quintals. In areas where the native vegetation died, the leaves and berries Liberian coffee plants were unscathed. Though the Arabian coffee plants withered, their berries were salvaged for low-quality coffee.\\n\\nDuring the initial eruption phase, birds were observed in a dazed condition on roads. The stench of animal corpses rotting beneath volcanic debris was intense according to Gustav Eisen who reported the forest conditions in 1903. The loss of life among mammals was believed to be enormous, greater than that of avian creatures. Cattle also died in large numbers; some perished during the eruption or in the subsequent days from consuming ash-contaminated water and grass. Insects were among the fauna that recovered quicker; Eisen found butterflies, beetles, mosquitoes and flies in abundance. He also noticed zompopos ants, a species of leafcutter ants carrying the buried brown soil towards the surface of ash. Blackbirds also returned to the area a month after the eruption.\\n\\nEstimates of the death toll range from 5,000 to 8,700. Those in close proximity to the crater likely died while many more were killed by roof collapses. Many buildings sustained collapsed roof due to the weight of ash it had collected. A malaria outbreak added to the fatalities. In Suiza, a building heavily occupied by those escaping the eruption collapsed under the accumulated ash, killing 18.\\n\\nAftermath\\nPresident Manuel Estrada Cabrera attempted to downplay the impact of the eruption. The eruption occurred hours before the Fiestas Minervalias, a propaganda fair, was supposed to begin. The 26 October issue of Diario de Centro América was heavily focused on the festival while it made no mention of the eruption. No issues were published on 27 and 28 October due to the festival. The first story about the eruption was only published on 3 November. There were no official actions in attempting to calculate the number of fatalities and aid only reached the affected departments in December.\\n\\nWhile the eruption continued, the regional authorities of Quetzaltenango became responsible for handling the crisis, as attention of the national government was focused on Fiestas Minervalias. In an attempt to suppress the impact of the eruption, citizens were informed the eruption occurred in México. Furthermore, the official government informed Quetzaltenango authorities that no funds were available for recovery, as were absorbed by the response missions following the April earthquake. Quetzaltenango regional authorities announced that the West zone agricultural harvest was destroyed, and forecasted a famine due to food shortages. The deaths of cattle also led to a meat shortage. They were allowed by the central government to import flour free of taxes for the next few months.\\n\\nOn top of food shortages, the lack of water and power supply due to ash added to the turmoil of residents. It took several months for these services to be fully functional. Residents began to clear ash from their roofs to prevent further cave-ins. On 12 November, President Cabrera established the General Supply of Aid for Agriculture to support struggling farmers and the agricultural industry. In late November, Quetzaltenango officials allocated 15,000 pesos for cleaning works an another 5,000 to repair its aqueducts.\\n\\nSee also\\nList of largest volcanic eruptions\\nList of volcanic eruptions by death toll\\nList of volcanoes in Guatemala\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nCategory:20th-century volcanic events\\nCategory:VEI-6 eruptions\\nCategory:1902 in Guatemala\\nCategory:October 1902 events\\nCategory:Quetzaltenango Department\\nCategory:1902 natural disasters\",\n",

       " 'On March 6, 1998, 68-year-old contract courier William Clinton Clayton Jr. was shot to death by an unknown person while he was taking money out of an ATM in downtown Centre, Alabama. The killer was later identified as Keith Edmund Gavin, a resident of Chicago who was out on parole after serving 16 years of a 34-year jail term for a 1982 murder case in his native state of Illinois. Gavin was convicted of the murder and sentenced to death in 1999, and he was incarcerated on death row for about 25 years before he was executed via lethal injection on July 18, 2024.\\n\\nBackground\\nWilliam Clinton Clayton Jr.\\nBorn in Birmingham, Jefferson County, Alabama on December 10, 1929, William Clinton Clayton Jr., affectionately known as Bill, grew up in Alabama and he studied up to high school, although he did not complete his high school education. Sometime after he left school, Clayton served in the army at one point and was a Korean War veteran.\\n\\nClayton married his wife in 1960 and together, the couple had seven children. According to his son, Clayton was a hard-working and dedicated family man who worked in various jobs, including custodial work, railroad work and various driving jobs, and he was said to be a simple man who had learning disabilities.\\n\\nAt the time of his death in 1998, Clayton worked as a contract courier.\\n\\nKeith Edmund Gavin\\n\\nBorn in Chicago, Illinois on March 30, 1960, Keith Edmund Gavin, the second of 12 children in his family, grew up in a ghetto-like neighbourhood where drug activity and gang violence was rampant. Gavin\\'s father reportedly had a harsh disciplinary style towards Gavin, who later dropped out of school in the 11th grade.GAVIN v. COMMISSIONER ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS [2022], United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit (United States).\\n\\nGavin\\'s criminal history was first dated back in 1979, when he was found guilty of burglary on October 25 of that same year. In early 1982, at the age of 22, Gavin shot an unarmed man in Cook County, Illinois, and the man, whose identity remains unknown, died from the shooting. On June 9, 1982, Gavin was convicted of murder and sentenced to 34 years in jail. During his incarceration, Gavin completed his GED and also took up some college courses.GAVIN v. STATE [2003], Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals (United States).\\n\\nIn December 1997, after serving less than 16 years behind bars, Gavin was granted parole and released from prison. However, merely four months later, Gavin would commit murder a second time.\\n\\nClayton\\'s murder\\nOn March 6, 1998, in Centre, Cherokee County, Alabama, 68-year-old William Clayton Jr. was murdered via shooting by Keith Edmund Gavin, who was then two weeks short of turning 38.\\n\\nOn that fateful day, Clayton was preparing to bring his wife out for dinner, and he drove his workplace van to an ATM at Regions Bank to withdraw some money for the dinner night. At the same time, Gavin, accompanied by his cousin Dewayne Lemark Meeks, who worked in the Illinois Department of Corrections, were driving from Gavin\\'s hometown in Chicago to Alabama to locate a woman whom Gavin met in the past. After the duo reached downtown Centre, they came across Clayton, who was then at the ATM withdrawing money. According to prosecutors, Gavin formed an intention to rob Clayton, and hence, he departed his cousin\\'s car and approached Clayton with his cousin\\'s .40-calibre Glock pistol, opening the door of Clayton\\'s van and fired two shots at Clayton, who was pushed into the passenger\\'s seat by Gavin, who took over the wheel and drove away in Clayton\\'s van. The shooting itself was witnessed by Gavin\\'s cousin, who fled the scene out of fear. Three more eyewitnesses – Larry Twilley, Ronald Baker and Richard Henry Jr. – also testified they saw a gunman, whom they identified as Gavin, opening the side door of Clayton\\'s van and shooting Clayton twice.\\n\\nDanny Smith, an investigator from the District Attorney\\'s Office of the Ninth Judicial Circuit caught sight of Clayton\\'s van and gave chase. After reaching the middle of an intersection, Gavin stopped the van and fled into the nearby woods, and he also fired twice at the officer (who escaped unscathed) while making his escape, leaving behind Clayton, who was discovered barely alive and sustaining three gunshot wounds in the van. Clayton was rushed to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival. An autopsy revealed that one of the two bullets in Clayton\\'s body penetrated the left arm, heart and lungs, and it was stuck at the passenger-side door of the van. The second one entered Clayton\\'s left hip and was stuck on his back.\\n\\nA manhunt was swiftly carried out to capture Gavin. Police dogs were also dispatched during the search, and one of the dogs was able to find Gavin hiding in a creek, and the police cornered Gavin, who attempted to escape. However, the attempt was futile, and Gavin was arrested and subsequently taken into police custody.\\n\\nGavin\\'s trial and sentencing\\nCharges\\nAfter his arrest, Keith Gavin, who introduced himself as \"Keith Edmunds\" to the police, was initially charged under his fake alias for the murder of William Clayton Jr., before his real name and previous conviction for murder in 1982 was discovered by the Alabama authorities.\\n\\nIn April 1998, Dewayne Meeks, who was then 33 years old and married with a son, became the second person to be charged with murder after the gun issued to him by the Illinois Department of Corrections was connected to the fatal shooting of Clayton, and the US$50,000 bond granted to Meeks was revoked. Three months after he was first charged, the prosecution decided to drop the murder charge against Meeks in July 1998, leaving Gavin the only person left facing a murder charge.\\n\\nJury trial and verdict\\nOn November 3, 1999, Gavin stood trial before a 12-member jury at the Cherokee County Circuit Court for one count of murder and one count of attempted murder. For the most serious charge of murder, the potential punishment was either the death penalty or life in prison without the possibility of parole.\\n\\nIn midst of the trial, the defence counsel representing Gavin in court sought to push the blame on his cousin Dwayne Meeks, who turned state evidence against Gavin in court, and stated that there was no direct evidence to connect the murder weapon to Gavin, and raised arguments to cast doubts over the incriminating evidence against Gavin.\\n\\nOn November 7, 1999, the jury found Gavin guilty of both counts of murder and attempted murder.\\n\\nOn November 17, 1999, the jury released its decision on sentence, with ten jurors recommending a death sentence for Gavin while the final two jurors settled on a life sentence. Under Alabama law, a judge had the discretion to impose the death penalty if the jury made a unanimous decision or alternatively, a minimum of ten jurors out of 12 agreed to sentence an accused to death. For security reasons, Gavin was transferred to the St. Clair Correctional Facility prior to his official sentencing, which was originally scheduled to occur on December 6, 1999, but the hearing was delayed to January 5, 2000.\\n\\nOn January 5, 2000, for the charge of murdering William Clayton Jr., 39-year-old Keith Edmund Gavin was sentenced to death by Circuit Judge David A. Rains, who agreed with the jury\\'s decision during sentencing. Justice Rains also sentenced Gavin to life imprisonment for the other charge of attempted murder of Danny Smith. The death sentence of Gavin was reportedly the first death sentence meted out by Justice Rains nearly 20 years after he was first appointed as a judge.\\n\\nAppeals and death warrant\\nAppeal process\\nIn June 2000, Keith Gavin petitioned for a new trial in his case, claiming that his original trial counsel was ineffective and there was selective prosecution in his case.\\n\\nIn September 2003, Gavin filed an appeal to the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals, arguing that he was innocent and falsely implicated in the murder by his cousin Dewayne Meeks, whom he continued to finger as the real killer. He also attempted to argue that he was being unfairly judged due to racial bias since he was African-American and most of the jurors who voted to convict him were white, and he was more likely to be indicted for capital murder in predominantly white Cherokee County as an African-American compared to a white. However, Gavin\\'s appeal was dismissed. A follow-up appeal to the Supreme Court of Alabama was also dismissed on May 28, 2004.Ex parte Keith Edmund GAVIN. [2004], Supreme Court of Alabama (United States). The U.S. Supreme Court later rejected the appeal of Gavin in 2005.GAVIN v. ALABAMA [2005], Supreme Court of the United States (United States).\\n\\nIn 2020, a federal judge heard Gavin\\'s appeal at the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, and ruled that Gavin had ineffective counsel at his sentencing hearing because his original lawyers failed to present more mitigating evidence of Gavin\\'s violent and abusive childhood in Chicago, which would have warranted a possible sentence of life without parole.Gavin v. Dunn [2020], United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama (United States). Two years later, in July 2022, the ruling was struck down by the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals after the court found that Gavin\\'s trial counsel were not ineffective in their duties and maintained the death sentence in his case.\\n\\nDeath warrant and final appeals\\nOn April 18, 2024, the Alabama Supreme Court authorized the death warrant of Gavin after approving the request of the state attorney general. On April 26, 2024, about a week after the approval of his death warrant, Gavin\\'s death sentence was scheduled to be carried out via lethal injection on July 18, 2024. Gavin was the third death row convict in Alabama to receive a death warrant, and just a month prior, a man named Jamie Ray Mills was the second condemned person to have his execution date set for murdering an elderly couple; Mills was executed via lethal injection on May 30, 2024, four months after Kenneth Eugene Smith became the first in Alabama and elsewhere in the world to be executed via nitrogen gas inhalation.\\n\\nOn July 9, 2024, nine days before his scheduled execution, Gavin filed a legal motion to not undergo an autopsy after his death. Gavin, who converted to Islam while on death row, stated that the teachings preached to him cited that as a Muslim, his human body was sacred and must be kept whole, and an autopsy might desecrate his body and violate the sanctity of having a complete body even after death. Three days later, on July 12, 2024, six days before Gavin was due to be executed, an Alabama court permitted Gavin\\'s request to waive an autopsy in his case.\\n\\nAlthough Gavin confirmed that he would not seek a stay of execution during his lawsuit to stave off the post-mortem examination of his body, he filed a last-minute appeal during the final week leading up to his execution. In the appeal itself, Gavin petitioned for a stay of execution and maintained that he was innocent and never killed Clayton, and asked for a review of his case. The Alabama Supreme Court rejected the plea, and finally, hours before Gavin was slated to be executed, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to halt the execution and rejected the petition.Gavin v. Alabama [2024], Supreme Court of the United States (United States).\\n\\nOn the eve of Gavin\\'s execution, Clayton\\'s youngest son spoke up in the media about the case. Matthew \"Matt\" Joseph Clayton, who was 28 when his father died, told the press that Clayton was a \"gentle giant\" and great father to his children, and Matt said the family could not believe he would meet such a violent end and were shocked when the murder occurred. Matt revealed that his mother was still healthy at the age of 94 and he felt lucky to have his mother around for most of his life since his father left at a younger age, and while he noted that Gavin was not remorseful for the murder of his father, the family had long forgiven him for the tragedy, partly on account of Gavin\\'s tragic childhood and upbringing. Matt expressed his intention to attend the execution of Gavin, mainly to represent his family and to acknowledge the efforts of the state officials in bringing his father\\'s killer to justice.\\n\\nExecution\\nOn July 18, 2024, 26 years after he murdered William Clayton Jr., 64-year-old Keith Edmund Gavin was officially put to death via lethal injection at Holman Correctional Facility. Before the drugs were administered to him at 6.16pm, Gavin said his last words, \"I love my family.\", and he also made some Muslim prayers prior to closing his eyes at 6.20pm, and he was pronounced dead at 6.32pm. Witnesses of the execution noted there were no major problems with the execution procedure.\\n\\nMatt Clayton, the victim\\'s youngest son who witnessed the execution, told the press that his father was a good man who was deadly missed by his wife and children and he \"did not deserve to die this way\". He also questioned why Gavin was released on parole despite his 1982 murder conviction in Illinois. Alabama state governor Kay Ivey released a media statement and stated that justice was served for Clayton\\'s loved ones after the execution of Gavin and she offered her prayers to Clayton\\'s family.\\n\\nAccording to the Alabama Department of Corrections, on the eve of his execution, Gavin refused to have breakfast, lunch and dinner but ate a bag of Ruffles cheddar sour cream potato chips, a bag of Lay\\'s plain potato chips and a Hershey chocolate bar with almonds. On the date of his execution, Gavin reportedly declined a last meal offer, but he helped himself with ice cream and Mountain Dew.\\n\\nGavin was the third condemned criminal from Alabama, as well as the tenth convict in the U.S. to be executed during the year of 2024.\\n\\nSee also\\n Capital punishment in Alabama\\n List of people executed in Alabama\\n List of people executed in the United States in 2024\\n List of most recent executions by jurisdiction\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nCategory:1998 in Alabama\\nCategory:1998 murders in the United States\\nCategory:21st-century executions by Alabama\\nCategory:March 1998 crimes in the United States\\nCategory:Murder in Alabama\\nCategory:People murdered in Alabama',\n",

       " 'thumb|Henry Kailimai and his Hawaiian Quintet, among the first to perform hapa haole in the mainland United StatesHapa haole music ( in Hawaiian) is a genre of Hawaiian music which utilizes primarily English lyrics with themes and instruments attributed to Hawaii, such as the ukulele and steel guitar. Although it has its beginnings in the early 20th century with influences traditional Hawaiian music and American ragtime, the term \"hapa haole\" now comprises a wide variety of styles, including swing, rock and roll, and rap. It became greatly popular in the mainland United States in the 1910s, appealing to touristic perceptions of Hawaii as an exotic paradise.\\n\\n Description \\n\\n Etymology \\n\"Hapa haole\" is a Hawaiian term referring to someone of part-Hawaiian, part-foreign ancestry. It emerged after Christian missionaries in Hawaii introduced the term \"half\" to Hawaiians, which became \"hapa\" in Hawaiian.\\n\\n Style \\nHapa haole is described as Hawaiian music that uses primarily English lyrics, with both real and mock Hawaiian words sometimes included. Its lyrical content usually focuses on the people, culture, and nature of the Hawaiian Islands. Early hapa haole was influenced by music popular in the mainland United States in the early 20th century, especially ragtime. Throughout its evolution, hapa haole began to comprise other styles of music, including Hawaiian swing, rock and roll, and rap with English lyrics.\\n\\n History \\nthumb|259x259px|\"On the Beach at Waikiki\"\\nAround the beginning of the 20th century, stringed instruments, such as the ukulele and the steel guitar, overtook traditional wind instruments as the ones most commonly used by Hawaiian musicians. During this time, the phrase \"hapa haole\" first began to be used in reference to any Hawaiian song that had mostly English lyrics and influence from American genres. \"My Waikiki Mermaid\", possibly the first hapa haole song, was composed by Sonny Cunha in 1903.\\n\\nleft|thumb|252x252px|\"Yaaka Hula Hickey Dula\", a novelty song with faux-Hawaiian lyrics by Al Jolson\\n\\nHapa haole music was introduced to the mainland United States at multiple points through the 1910s. The 1912 Broadway musical The Bird of Paradise contained multiple songs from the genre. Additionally, hapa haole was widely performed by bands at the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in 1915 as a part of the exposition\\'s Hawaiian Pavilion. \"On the Beach at Waikiki\", a hapa haole composition by Henry Kailimai which was performed at the exposition,Tranquada, Jim; King, John (31 May 2012). The \\'Ukulele: A History. University of Hawaii Press. p. 94. ISBN 9780824865870. went on to become a major hit in the mainland, one of the first of the genre to do so.D\\'Ville, Jim; Peare, Gary (14 September 2023). \"Henry Kailimai and the Ford Hawaiians Introduced the Motor City to the \\'Sweet\\' Sound of Ukulele\". Ukulele Magazine. Vol. 42. Retrieved 31 August 2024. Following these initial introductions of the genre in the mainland, hapa haole and Hawaiian music as a whole began to find a large amount of attention and commercial success across the country. In 1916, hapa haole was the best-selling genre in the United States. The popularity of one hapa haole artist, Johnny Noble, led to him recording 110 Hawaiian songs with Brunswick Records, a mainland label, in 1928.\\n\\nNovelty songs written by non-Hawaiians, such as songwriters from Tin Pan Alley, formed a considerable amount of hapa haole songs produced following its initial explosion in popularity. Many of these songs were detached from actual Hawaiian culture, and used nonsensical, faux-Hawaiian lyrics. The songs also intended to appeal to American tourists\\' notions of Hawaii; specifically, the islands\\' perceived \"exoticism and seduction\". Later on, during the Hawaiian Renaissance of the 1970s, the genre was the subject of criticism due to its perceived inauthenticity.\\n\\nThe hapa haole \"craze\" peaked and began to dissipate in the 1930s. Harry Owens\\' \"Sweet Leilani\" became a number one hit in the United States following Bing Crosby\\'s performance of the song in the 1937 film Waikiki Wedding. The song won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1938. The genre gradually faded in popularity until the Hawaiian Renaissance led to renewed interest in Hawaiian music, including hapa haole. Although it had its beginnings in Hawaiian traditional music and ragtime, the genre evolved alongside American popular music, and now comprises other styles, including swing, rock and roll, and rap.\\n\\n References \\n\\nCategory:Music of Hawaii\\nCategory:American styles of music\\nCategory:20th-century music genres',\n",
       " 'The Pharmacy Museum of Lisbon is a museum dedicated to the history of pharmaceutical activity. It was established in the building of the National Association of Pharmacies, in the Santa Catarina district of the Portuguese capital, and was inaugurated in June 1996. A branch of the museum was created in the city of Porto in 2010. The first pieces that formed the Lisbon museum were those donated from the private collection of Dr. Salgueiro Basso. These were followed by several donations from other pharmacists and institutions, following a request sent out by the association, and augmented by purchases worldwide. The collection represents over 5,000 years of health history.\\nCollection\\nThe collection consists of over 15,000 pieces from various locations together with recreations of three pharmacies from Portugal and one from the former Portuguese colony of Macau, the only authentic Chinese pharmacy displayed in the western world. There is also a military pharmacy, and portable pharmacies used by King Carlos on his yacht, the Portuguese racing driver Carlos Sousa in the 2006 Dakar Rally, Roald Amundsen on his 1911 expedition to the North Pole, and by American astronauts on the Space Shuttle.  Items include those from the Pre-Columbian era, which identified analgesic and  hallucinogenic plants; Egypt, Mesopotamia and the Arab world, which introduced pharmaceuticals that included syrups and other confections that used sugar or honey; the Tibetan  approach that valued having a thorough knowledge of the human body; the Middle Ages, which saw the separation of the medical and pharmaceutical professions; and the modern age, which saw the emergence of instruments such as microscopes and thermometers. There are also exhibitions devoted to African medicine, which has developed rituals for the treatment of the body and spirit of patients, using sacrifices and dances as healing methods, as well as traditional Chinese medicine.\\nthumb|250px|One of the recreated pharmacies at the museum\\nSpecific items on display include tools used by pharmacies to manufacture medicines, such as mortars and scales, as well as many storage vessels and bottles, including ancient Greek storage jars, Roman glass ointment bottles, and Ottoman carafes. A major exhibit is an Egyptian sarcophagus. Products sold in early Portuguese pharmacies in the 18th and 19th centuries, such as Água de Inglaterra a cure for malaria, are exhibited. The museum has a good display of laboratory equipment such as distillers, a furnace, scales, copper and cast-iron pots and retorts. Another display shows embalmed animals or animal parts, tiger bones, snake venom and other items used to prepare remedies. Notable in the exhibition of storage vessels are pictures on the containers that enable us to identify the usage of the various medicinal powders that they contained. A collection of household remedies is stored in drawers that show the relevant parts of the human body for treatment with the cure contained inside. Other items to be seen include chastity belts and early condoms.  \\n\\nIn addition, the museum focuses on important Portuguese chemists, such as Odette Ferreira who played a significant role in identifying the HIV-2 virus. \\nAwards received\\nThe Pharmacy Museum in Lisbon has won numerous awards, including:\\n Best Portuguese Museum in 1996, 1997, 1998 \\n Best Pharmaceutical Project in 1999 \\n Premio Almofariz 1999\\n National Design and Communication Award in 2002\\n Nominated for the European Museum of the Year Award in 2004\\n Best Cultural Extension Service Award in 2008\\nReferences\\n\\nCategory:Museums in Lisbon\\nCategory:Buildings and structures in Lisbon\\nCategory:Pharmacy museums\\nCategory:Tourist attractions in Lisbon',\n",

       " ' The Big Beat scandal was a national television controversy in the United States, mainly concerned with the racial issue focusing on Black American and White individuals dancing interracially while The Big Beat was broadcast on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) Network, which was hosted by Alan Freed.\\n\\n History \\nThe Big Beat was the first interracial teen show broadcast in New York City which was debuted on May 4, 1957. On July 19 same year, New York-based American black teen singer Frankie Lymon was dancing with a white girl, causing the outrage in TV stations at the Southern states. In the Southern states, racial segregation was \"still in effect\" since the civil rights movement was at its earliest stages. Few weeks after the incident, the show was immediately cancelled after four episodes. Therefore, the ABC executives \"buckled under the pressure.\"\\n\\nFollowing the incident regarding interracial dance between Frankie Lymon and a white girl, Freed was often featured in magazines and newspapers which he wore \"bright scarlet tuxedos or outsized window-plaid sport coats punctuated with a wispy silk bow tie favored by African American or white hillbilly artists.\" Therefore, Freed was fired from the ABC.\\n\\nAccording to an American Bandstand producer to New York Post, the interracial dance between Frankie Lymon and a white girl \"contributed to American Bandstand\\'s segregation.\" It is also revealed that The Milt Grant Show faced similar issues two months prior to the following incident.\\n\\nRegardless of the controversies among Southern Americans who were working in TV stations, Freed was inducted along with Elvis Presley, Little Richard, Chuck Berry, and Jerry Lee Lewis into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame \"in its very first class\" in 1986 because he promoted the interracial dance.\\n\\nIt appears that the clip of final episode does not exist, but the audio files remain online.\\n\\nSee also\\n The Big Beat (TV program)\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n Spots and Auditions at Alan Freed\\'s official website.\\n\\nCategory:1957 scandals\\nCategory:Scandals in the United States\\nCategory:Racism in the United States\\nCategory:Frankie Lymon',\n",

       " 'Henry Niemann (April 27, 1838 – October 26, 1899) was a German-born pipe organ builder, who spent most of his career in Baltimore, Maryland. Of all the Baltimore organ builders, Niemann produced the most extant organs, some still in very good condition and retaining the tonal essence of his work.

In 1857 at the age of 19, Niemann came to America where he found employment with organ builder John Closs in Cincinnati, Ohio.\\n\\nAfter two years in Cincinnati, he left for England to advance his knowledge of organ building. He worked there for three years with Charles S. Barker, known for his early use of pneumatic pipe organ actions.\\n\\nIn 1862 Niemann went to France to work for the most distinguished organ builder of the 19th century, Aristide Cavaillé-Coll, where he stayed five years. Both Barker and Cavaillé-Coll had high praise for Niemann\\'s work. While in Paris, Niemann built several small organs, then left France to build a three-manual organ for the \"Parr Kirche\" in Meppen, Germany.

       " 'Raymond Bernard (19 May 1923 – 10 January 2006) was a French esotericist and freemason. He was the Grand Master of AMORC, a large Rosicrucian order, in Francophone countries. He separately founded several other esoteric organizations, including the Renewed Order of the Temple.   \\n\\n Early life \\nRaymond Bernard was born in Bourg-d’Oisans, Isère on 19 May 1923. He was raised in a Catholic family who had origins in Dauphiné, and attended secondary school in Grenoble. He studied law at a school there, though his studies were interrupted by the Second World War.\\n\\n Esotericism \\nIn 1941, he was introduced to esotericism by an English Rosicrucian by the name of Edith Lynn, and a few years later he came into contact with the Jeanne Guesdon, as well as Ralph M. Lewis, both high ranking AMORC figures. In 1952 he was admitted to AMORC\\'s inner knighthood, and Lewis appointed him an administrator of the organization in 1965; Lewis then appointed him as AMORC\\'s grand master in Francophone countries, a post he held from 1959 to 1977. He served many positions in the organization, structuring it in Francophone nations (especially African ones). Due to the resulting success, he acquired a château for AMORC in 1969, which became the headquarters of the Francophone Grand Lodge in 1973. In the 1950s, he was also involved in Italian Freemasonry, and joined the French Grande Loge nationale française Opéra, where he achieved the three symbolic grades given out by the organization.\\n\\nAt this time, he was initiated into the  (OMT), which Lewis gave him the responsibility to re-establish in France; he did this alongside AMORC, though given the reputation OMT had in the United States this was made difficult. In 1970, he founded the Renewed Order of the Temple (, ORT) of which he became the secret grand master until 1972. The group was founded at the suggestion of Julien Origas, also a member of AMORC, to which Bernard enthusiastically agreed. The creation of this group was supposedly validated by a \"White Cardinal\" apparition that had appeared to Bernard in Rome. He left this group entirely in the following years, and it was then led by Origas. Following the death of Origas, ORT schismed, and one of the resulting schismatic organizations later formed the Order of the Solar Temple, a group notorious for the mass murder-suicides committed by its members.\\n\\nHe resigned from AMORC in 1987, after which he founded the  (CIRCES) and  (OSTI), both of which aimed to continue Templar ideals but did not claim a direct lineage from the original Templars. He was also head of Circles International, which combined Templar ideals with New Age ones. He was the Grand Master of both groups, and they merged in 1993, with CIRCES becoming the charity wing of the OSTI as the . In the late 1990s he entrusted responsibility of the organization to Yves Jayet, giving him the status of Grand Master, after which he had no direct control. He joined the Grande Loge de France in 1991 following his departure from AMORC.\\n\\nHe wrote several books that included representations of esoteric elements like Agartha, Rosicrucian orders, as well as an occult world government controlled by a figured called \"Maha\"; these were allegorical works, though many took them literally.\\n\\n Later life and death \\nHis influence is significant in Africa, where he spread AMORC through French-speaking countries and their heads of state.

       " 'Mary Jane Jackson (born 1836 – disappeared  1863) was an American serial killer, prostitute, and criminal active in New Orleans, Louisiana, from the 1840s to 1860s. She was nicknamed \"Bricktop\" due to her bright red hair.\\n\\nEarly life\\nJackson was born in 1836 on Girod St. in New Orleans. She became a prostitute at the age of 13 and, at 14, the mistress of a local saloon owner. After he split with her three years later, she beat him to the point of hospitalization, leaving him with a broken nose and without an ear. After this, she bounced around different brothels, as she could not get along with other prostitutes.\\n\\nMurders\\nJackson committed her first murder in 1856 at the age of 20, beating a man to death after he called her a \"whore.\" The following year, she fatally stabbed a man nicknamed Long Charley (due to his height of almost 7 feet).\\n\\nOn November 7, 1859, Jackson went to a saloon on Rampart St. with two other women, Ellen Collins and America Williams. After a blacksmith named Laurent Fleury, who was seated nearby, asked her to stop cussing, she continued to do so louder out of spite. Laurent got up and slapped Jackson across the face, after which Jackson and the two other women stabbed him to death. When police arrived, they found Fleury\\'s pants pocket and money in Jackson\\'s possession. She was brought to Parish Prison but was released after an autopsy failed to establish Fleury\\'s cause of death.\\n\\nWhile imprisoned, Jackson fell in love with a jailer, criminal, and fight manager named John Miller (b. 1829 in Gretna), who himself had murdered several people in New Orleans. After her release, they committed robberies together in the French Quarter.\\n\\nOn the night of December 5, 1861, Miller told neighbors outside of their home in Gretna that Jackson \"needed a thrashing\" and went inside; the subsequent altercation ended with Miller being fatally stabbed. Jackson received a ten-year prison sentence for the murder but was released nine months later, after George F. Shepley emptied the local prisons due to the ongoing American Civil War. After her release, Jackson left New Orleans and was never heard from again.\\n\\nSee also\\n List of serial killers before 1900\\n List of serial killers in the United States\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nCategory:1836 births\\nCategory:19th-century American criminals\\nCategory:19th-century American women\\nCategory:American female prostitutes\\nCategory:American female serial killers\\nCategory:American prostitutes\\nCategory:Criminals from Louisiana\\nCategory:Serial killers from Louisiana\\nCategory:Year of death unknown',\n",
       " 'Alaris, Inc., was an American computer hardware and software vendor active from 1991 to 2002. During the first half of its existence, the company sold high-performance x86- and PowerPC-based motherboards (manufactured by IBM) as either aftermarket upgrades for consumers or for OEMs to put in their own computer systems. Alaris also briefly sold its own computer systems. In 1996, the company pivoted to software, releasing the Videogram suite of video compression software intended for low-bandwidth websites and email. In 2002, the company was acquired in whole by a Japanese electronics conglomerate.\\n\\nHistory\\nHardware products (1991–1996)\\nthumb|An original Leopard board by Alaris, built in early 1994\\nAlaris, Inc., was founded by Raymond Yu in Fremont, California, in 1991, as a producer of high-performance motherboards for personal computers. The company operated in stealth mode for the first two years of its existence before announcing in March 1993 that it had signed a contract with IBM for the latter to produce PC motherboards based on Alaris\\'s specifications from IBM\\'s Microelectronics plants in Burlington, Vermont, and Charlotte, North Carolina. Alaris\\'s motherboards initially made exclusive use of IBM\\'s 486SLC line of processors, a licensed clone of Intel\\'s i486SX which IBM introduced in 1992. Alaris paid IBM US$127\\xa0million for the contract, representing a total shipment of several hundred thousands of motherboards. Yu had previously considered Solectron and SCI Systems as manufacturers of their motherboards but ultimately turned to IBM for their more rigorous testing services and three-year warranty program. By 1994, Alaris was one of IBM\\'s largest customers, as well as one of the most popular vendors of IBM\\'s x86-based processors. Said Yu the previous year: \"I don\\'t consider [IBM] a contractor. I consider them a partner\".\\n\\nAlaris\\' first motherboard, the Leopard, was announced in July 1993 and began shipping later in the year. The motherboard was equipped with the 486SLC2 clocked at 66\\xa0MHz, featured eight ISA slots (two with VLB extensions), and was upgradable to 16\\xa0MB of RAM. In August 1993, Alaris announced the fully 32-bit Cougar motherboard, which came equipped with IBM\\'s \"Blue Lightning\" 486BL processor clocked at 75\\xa0MHz (25\\xa0MHz internal bus) onto a socket supporting an optional aftermarket Pentium OverDrive, seven ISA expansion slots (two with VLB expansions, one of which is preoccupied with a VLB disk controller card), and an i387SX math coprocessor. The Cougar was incorporated onto Alaris\\' first computer system, the Alaris Cougar EnergySmart PC BL3X/75, released in the summer of 1994. The computer system received generally positive reviews in InfoWorld and PC Magazine, with writer Tom Albano of the latter publication considering it superior to IBM\\'s own Ambra Lightning 100 system, despite the latter\\'s processor being clocked faster at 100\\xa0MHz.\\n\\nIn April 1994, Alaris introduced the successor to the original Leopard, the Leopard Plus, which shipped with the same 486SLC2 processor clocked at 66\\xa0MHz but put it on a Pentium OverDrive socket like the Cougar and added an additional VLB slot, a flash-upgradable BIOS ROM, a COAST slot for extra processor cache, and optimized support for the company\\'s EnergySmart power conservation software.\\n\\nIn June 1994, Alaris became one of the first computer systems manufacturers outside the Apple–IBM–Motorola alliance to announce a desktop computer system based on the PowerPC platform. The company slated their PowerPC offerings for a late 1994 release, pending the delivery of the PowerPC version of IBM\\'s OS/2 (later released as Workplace OS in 1995), as well as Microsoft\\'s Windows NT 3.5 for PowerPC. In November 1994, Alaris introduced the Cian line of upgradable computers, which had the ability to change the computer bus between multiple standards through a riser card on the motherboard. One such option was to upgrade the bus from x86 and ISA to PowerPC and PCI.\\n\\nIn fall 1994, Alaris became the first company to ship a computer with NexGen\\'s Nx586 processor, which was a competitor to Intel\\'s Pentium processor manufactured at IBM Microelectronics in Burlington. Their partnership was announced in July 1994, with the first computers, based on the 60- and 66-MHz Nx586 processor, slated for a September 1994 release. In August 1994, Alaris upgraded the terms of their agreement with NexGen, with Alaris becoming NexGen\\'s primary developer of motherboard specifications and other hardware products for OEMs. By late 1994, Alaris had released VLB computer systems with 90- and 100-MHz versions of the Nx586. In 1995, they delivered a 100-MHz Nx586 system. Alaris supplied NexGen-based motherboards to several other computer systems manufacturers during this time, including Aberdeen, Inc.; Blackship Computer Systems; Datastor; Duracom Computer Systems; Maximus Computer Systems; and Tangent Computer.\\n\\nAlaris announced their first graphics card with the Stinger in November 1994. Released in the following January, the Stinger is a 64-bit PCI card based on S3\\'s Vision864 GPU; with the stock 1\\xa0MB of VRAM, it supports up to 24-bit color at a 800-by-600-pixel resolution or 8-bit color at 1024-by-768-pixel resolution. With 2\\xa0MB of VRAM, the Stinger supports a maximum resolution of 1600\\xa0by 1200\\xa0pixels. Alaris followed up the Stinger with the Matinee, also PCI-based and which came with 2-MB of VRAM stock.\\n\\nVideogram (1996–2002)\\nIn 1996, Alaris began shifting away from motherboard and graphics card design in favor of developing software for compressing digital video into file sizes and bitrates appropriate for the computer hardware of the time. That year, the company hired Ilya Asnis, an immigrant of Saint Petersburg who developed a software package capable of transcoding video into very small file sizes, appropriate for sending via email as attachments. Alaris named the software Videogram and released it in March 1996. The Videogram suite comprised three products: the Videogram Player software, for playback; the Videogram Packager software, for transcoding; and the Quick Video Transport ISA TV tuner, for grabbing video from composite video sources. The original Packager software resampled the video down to a resolution of 320\\xa0by 240\\xa0pixels at 15\\xa0frames per second, capable of compressing a 5-MB video file down to 210\\xa0KB. Both the Videogram codec and the QuickVideo ISA card were developed in-house at Alaris; unlike most other video compression solutions at the time, Alaris\\' codec was not based on MPEG. In August 1996, Alaris developed a professional version of the Videogram software aimed at the industrial Web video streaming market.\\n\\nAlaris briefly returned to the computer system market after announcing that they had signed on to produce a PowerPC motherboard based on Motorola\\'s Yellowknife reference design in November 1996. However, their partnership with Motorola was limited to producing boards as OEM evaulation units and proved fleeting.\\n\\nIn February 1998, Alaris released the QuickVideo DVC I, a webcam and general-purpose video camera capable of recording video at a resolution of 508\\xa0by 492\\xa0pixels at 30\\xa0frames per second at 24-bit color. Alaris pre-packaged the DVC I with the Videogram Creator software (essentially the Player and Packager software rolled into one package).\\n\\nIn 2002, Alaris was acquired in whole by a Japanese electronics conglomerate.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n\\n \\n\\nCategory:1991 establishments in California\\nCategory:2002 disestablishments in California\\nCategory:American companies established in 1991\\nCategory:American companies disestablished in 2002\\nCategory:Computer companies established in 1991\\nCategory:Computer companies disestablished in 2002\\nCategory:Defunct computer companies of the United States\\nCategory:Defunct computer hardware companies\\nCategory:Defunct computer systems companies\\nCategory:Defunct software companies of the United States\\nCategory:Motherboard companies',\n",

Classify 64 teams, the number varies according to the number of teams in each group, being between three and eight clubs per group. The country will be divided into two zones: South Zone (Groups 1 to 8) and North Zone (Groups 9 to 17). Eliminations will be held according to the average obtained by each team, being ordered from best to worst by their percentage throughout the season.\\n\\nAs of 2020–21 season, the names of the knockout stages were modified as follows: Round of 32, Round of 16, Quarter-finals, Semifinals, Zone Final and Final, this as a consequence of the division of the country into two zones, for so the teams only face clubs from the same region until the final series.\\n\\nReserve and Development Teams\\nEach season a table is created among those teams that don\\'t have the right to promote, because they are considered as reserve teams for teams that play in Liga MX, Liga de Expansión and Liga Premier or are independent teams that have requested not to participate for the Promotion due to the fact that they are footballers development projects. The ranking order is determined through the \"quotient\", which is obtained by dividing the points obtained between the disputed matches, being ordered from highest to lowest. Starting this season, the league decided to divide these teams into two regions, as it happens with the promotion play-offs, so in the final phase the teams will only face rivals from their region, until reaching the national final, which will pit the two regional champions of this modality of the league against each other.\\n\\nTables\\nSouth Zone\\n P Team Pts G Pts/G GD 1  Atlético Quintanarroense  0  0  .000   0 2  Boston Cancún  0  0  .000   0 3  Deportiva Venados  0  0  .000   0 4  Alebrijes de Oaxaca  0  0  .000   0 5  Artesanos Bajos de Chila  0  0  .000   0 6  Aragón  0  0  .000   0 7  Atlante Chalco  0  0  .000   0 8  Cañoneros  0  0  .000   0 9  Irapuato Olimpo  0  0  .000   0 10  Juárez  0  0  .000   0 11  Artesanos Metepec  0  0  .000   0 12  Zitácuaro  0  0  .000   0 13  Alebrijes CDMX  0  0  .000   0 14  Ciervos  0  0  .000   0 15  Alebrijes Teotihuacán  0  0  .000   0 16  Balam  0  0  .000   0 17  Faraones de Texcoco  0  0  .000   0 18  Pachuca  0  0  .000   0\\n\\nLast updated: September 4, 2024 Source: Liga TDPP = Position; G = Games played; Pts = Points; Pts/G = Ratio of points to games played; GD = Goal difference \\n\\nNorth Zone\\n P Team Pts G Pts/G GD 1  Celaya  0  0  .000   0 2  Mineros Querétaro  0  0  .000   0 3  Inter de Querétaro  0  0  .000   0 4  Inter Guanajuato  0  0  .000   0 5  Atlético Morelia–Universidad Michoacana  0  0  .000   0 6  Halcones AFU  0  0  .000   0 7  Irapuato  0  0  .000   0 8  León GEN  0  0  .000   0 9  Mineros de Zacatecas  0  0  .000   0 10  Necaxa  0  0  .000   0 11  Acatlán  0  0  .000   0 12  Leones Negros UdeG  0  0  .000   0 13  Tecos  0  0  .000   0 14  Ynjer Cuauhtémoc  0  0  .000   0 15  Atlético Acaponeta  0  0  .000   0 16  Atlético Nayarit  0  0  .000   0 17  Dorados de Sinaloa  0  0  .000   0 18  Tigres de Álica  0  0  .000   0 19  Calor Torreón  0  0  .000   0 20  Correcaminos UAT  0  0  .000   0 21  Real Apodaca  0  0  .000   0 22  Cimarrones de Sonora  0  0  .000   0 23  Xolos Hermosillo  0  0  .000   0 24  Tornados Tlaquepaque  0  0  .000   0\\n\\nLast updated: September 4, 2024 Source: Liga TDPP = Position; G = Games played; Pts = Points; Pts/G = Ratio of points to games played; GD = Goal difference \\n\\n See also \\n2024–25 Liga MX season\\n2024–25 Liga de Expansión MX season\\n2024–25 Serie A de México season\\n2024–25 Serie B de México season\\n2024 Copa Promesas MX\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n Official website of Liga TDP\\n\\n1',\n",

       " 'Mohammad \"Medo\" Halimy (Arabic: ميدو حليمي\\u200e; 2004/2005 – August 26, 2024) was a Palestinian social media personality and blogger based in the Gaza Strip. He was known for his “tent life” videos documenting his experiences living in a camp for displaced Palestinians during the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip. He was killed on August 26, 2024, after he was hit by a shrapnel during an Israeli airstrike on Gaza\\'s southern city of Khan Younis.\\n\\n Early life and education \\nHalimy was born and raised in Gaza City, Palestine. He was the son of Adi Al-Halimy. He had four brothers and a sister. Halimy was an alumnus United States Department of State’s Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study (YES) program which allows students from predominantly Muslim countries to live and study in the United States for an academic year. He was a student at Harker Heights High School in Harker Heights, Texas from 2021 to 2022. In the summer of 2023, Halimy worked in the Gaza-Based Spark charity. Prior to October 7th 2023, Halimy was a student at Gaza\\'s Al-Azhar University, studying political science and economics. On October 7th, 2023, Halimy’s family was displaced from their home in Gaza city following the Hamas attack on Israel and the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war. Throughout the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, his family was displaced multiple times moving between Khan Younis and Rafah. In late April 2024, they were sent back to Khan Younis following the invasion of Rafah. During this time, his grandmother has died due to medicine shortages from the ongoing blockade of the Gaza Strip.\\n\\n Online presence \\nHalimy launched his TikTok account after fleeing with his family to Muwasi, the southern coastal area of Gaza that Israel had designated a humanitarian safe zone. He gained a substantial following on Instagram and Tiktok in the summer of 2024 through his vlogs that documented his daily life in Gaza in a camp for internally-displaced Palestinians. He showcased his “tent life” which included sharing moments of joy during deadly conditions and limited internet access, as well as, how he did chores, secured food and managed boredom. Halimy stated these vlogs were to show the resilience, strength, and survival of the Palestinian people. In addition to these daily vlogs, he also had a gardening series where he would plant seeds outside his tent to represent life. Along with his collaborator Talal Murad, they created a joint Instagram page called Gazan Experience where they would answer user questions about how Gazans were living under the current conditions. Halimy was widely praised by viewers for finding small moments of joy amid the destruction around him.\\n\\n Death \\nOn August 26, 2024, Halimy was hit by a shrapnel during an Israeli airstrike on Gaza\\'s southern city of Khan Younis. The fatal strike happened in a nearby street to Halimy and his collaborator Murad who were both hit by the deadly debris of the strike. Murad describes a flaming car in front of them and seeing Halimy bleeding from his head. It took 10 minutes for a car to arrive. He was filmed by an NBC News crew as he was rushed to the intensive care unit of Khan Younis’ Nasser Hospital however, hours later, he succumbed to his injuries and died.\\n\\nHis death catalyzed an outpouring of grief on social media, where followers expressed shock and sadness at his death due to the close personal connections they had formed with him due to his videos.\\n\\n References \\n\\nCategory:2024 deaths\\nCategory:21st-century Palestinian artists\\nCategory:21st-century Palestinian male artists\\nCategory:21st-century Palestinian journalists\\nCategory:Alumni of Al-Azhar University – Gaza\\nCategory:Instagram people\\nCategory:Civilians killed in the Israel–Hamas war\\nCategory:Deaths by Israeli airstrikes\\nCategory:Journalists from the Gaza Strip\\nCategory:Journalists killed by Israeli security forces\\nCategory:Murdered Palestinian journalists\\nCategory:Palestinian Internet celebrities\\nCategory:People from Gaza City\\nCategory:People of the Israel–Hamas war\\nCategory:Year of birth uncertain',\n",

       " 'Dedicated Tolkien Societies provide platforms for a combination of Tolkien fandom and academic Tolkien studies in several countries.\\n\\n Societies by country \\n\\n United States \\n\\nThe first recorded organized Tolkien fan group was \"The Fellowship of the Ring\", founded by Ted Johnstone. Their first annual meeting was held at Pittcon, the 1960 Worldcon. They published four issues of the fanzine i-Palantír before the organization disbanded; the first was published a month before the Pittcon meeting, dated August 1960.\\n\\nThe Tolkien Society of America first met \"in February, 1965, beside the statue of Alma Mater on the Columbia University campus,\" according to a 1967 New York Times interview with Richard Plotz, the society\\'s founder and first Thain. By 1967, Meskys had become Thain and the society boasted over 1,000 members, organized into local groups or smials, a pattern that would be followed by other Tolkien fan organizations. The society published a newsletter, Green Dragon, and The Tolkien Journal (edited by Plotz). In 1969, the society sponsored the first Tolkien Conference at Belknap College. The Tolkien Conference was not a science fiction convention but a scholarly event. The University of Wisconsin Tolkien and Fantasy Society was founded in 1966, and is best known for its journal Orcrist (1966–1977), edited by Richard C. West. Across the continent, Glen GoodKnight founded the Mythopoeic Society in California in 1967 for the study, discussion, and enjoyment of fantastic and mythic literature, especially the works of Tolkien and fellow-Inklings C. S. Lewis, and Charles Williams. The society held its first Mythcon conference in 1970, which featured readings, a costume competition, an art show, and other events typical of science fiction conventions of the day. The society\\'s three current periodicals are Mythprint, a monthly bulletin; Mythlore, originally a fanzine and now a peer-reviewed journal that publishes scholarly articles on mythic and fantastic literature; and The Mythic Circle, a literary annual of original poetry and short stories (which replaced the society\\'s earlier publications Mythril and Mythellany). Alongside that was a monthly newsletter, Mythprint. Also available from the Chicago Tribune. Beyond Bree is the monthly newsletter of The American Mensa Tolkien Special Interest Group.\\n\\n United Kingdom \\n\\nThe Tolkien Society (UK) was founded in the United Kingdom in 1969, and remains active as a registered charity. The society has two regular publications, a bi-monthly bulletin of news and information, Amon Hen, and an annual journal, Mallorn; this began informally but switched to scholarly articles on Tolkien\\'s work. They host annual events, including a conference held at Oxford, Oxonmoot. The society has three regular UK gatherings: an Annual General Meeting and Dinner; a Seminar with a mix of serious and lighthearted talks; and the Oxonmoot, a regular September gathering organized by the British Tolkien Society. The society\\'s journal is Mallorn. It consists of long articles studying aspects of Tolkien\\'s work, plus some artwork. The name is a reference to the Mallorn tree and an illustration of such a tree appears on the front of each issue. In the past it was issued every autumn, but since 2003 has been released in mid-summer.\\n\\nGerman-speaking Europe\\n\\nThe German translation of The Hobbit appeared in 1957 (translated by Walter Scherf), and that of The Lord of the Rings in 1972 (translated by Margaret Carroux and ).\\n\\nThe Deutsche Tolkien Gesellschaft (DTG) is a German association dedicated to the study of the life and works of J.

In 2002, for its tenth anniversary, the society organized a joint conference with the Institute of English Studies of Károli Gáspár University of the Reformed Church in Hungary entitled \"J. R. R. Tolkien: Fantasy and Ethics\" and published a book of studies containing the papers presented. The Magyar Tolkien Társaság maintains relations with other tertiary institutions such as the Department of History and Philosophy of Science of Eötvös Loránd University, together with whom it regularly launches courses on Tolkienian subjects (\"J. R. R. Tolkien – A 20th Century Mythology\")\\n\\n Czech Republic \\nSpolečnost přátel díla pana J. R. R. Tolkiena (Society of Friends of the Works of J.R.R.

R. R. Tolkien society in Europe. It was started in Gothenburg, Sweden, in 1968 by members of Club Cosmos. They published the members\\' magazine Långbottenbladet. Originally it was just called \"The Tolkien Society\" but when the British society of the same name was created the members added \"of Sweden\" to its name.Fandboken 0.91\\n\\nThe Tolkien Society Forodrim (Sindarin for \"People of the North\") was founded in Sweden in 1972 and is one of the oldest Tolkien fan organizations. The Forodrim was founded in a public toilet during a science fiction convention (possibly SF-Kongressen 1973) as a name change of Sam J Lundwall\\'s Hyboria. Co-founders were Jörgen Peterzén and Anders Palm.Elfwood\\n\\nDenmark\\n\\nIn Denmark, Tolkien became well known in the 1970s; his works have since considerably influenced Danish language fantasy literature. In 1977, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark illustrated The Lord of the Rings. There are two Danish Tolkien societies; Bri, the Danish Tolkien Society,Bri and the online Imladris community.imladris.dk\\n\\nNorway\\n\\nThe Hobbit appeared in Norwegian translation in 1972 and The Lord of the Rings followed from 1973 to 1975 (Tiden Norsk Forlag). Both translations were harshly criticized for errors and inconsistencies and complaints resulted in a new translation of The Lord of the Rings, published in 1980/81. By the late 1980s, Tolkien\\'s works were well known to the Norwegian public. A translation of the Silmarillion appeared in 1994. The unsatisfactory Hobbit translation was replaced only in 1997. By the mid-1990s, the popularity of Tolkien had risen to a level that made viable translations of his minor works.\\n\\nArthedain – The Tolkien Society of Norway was founded in Oslo in 1981.\\n\\nFinland\\n\\nThe Finnish Tolkien Society Kontu (Suomen Tolkien-seura Kontu ry in Finnish) is a registered society based in Helsinki, Finland. The society was originally two different societies that unified at the beginning of 2012. The Finnish Tolkien Society (Suomen Tolkien seura) was founded on 3 January 1992 and Kontu Internet Community (Verkkoyhteisö Kontu ry) was founded on 19 December 2006. The main focus of the society is to improve knowledge of J. R. R. Tolkien and his works in Finland as well as to maintain the virtual community and thus the website the society originated from. The various parts of the website contain a discussion forum, a wiki and an IRC channel. KontuWiki has been credited in several Finnish Tolkien related publications since 2007. Every year the society awards the Kuvastaja-prize for the year\\'s best Finnish Fantasy book. There is much smial-activity and the society organizes meetings and other events for Tolkien fans from all over the country.\\n\\nRussia\\n\\nInterest in Russia awoke soon after the publication of The Lord of the Rings in 1955, long before the first Russian translation.\\nA first effort at publication was made in the 1960s, but to comply with literary censorship in Soviet Russia, the work was considerably abridged and transformed. The ideological danger of the book was seen in the \"hidden allegory \\'of the conflict between the individualist West and the totalitarian, Communist East.\\'\", while, ironically, Marxist readings in the west conversely identified Tolkien\\'s anti-industrial ideas as presented in the Shire with primitive communism, in a struggle with the evil forces of technocratic capitalism. Russian translations of The Lord of the Rings were published only after the collapse of the Soviet Union, but then in great numbers, no less than ten official Russian translations appeared between 1990 and 2005. Tolkien fandom in Russia grew especially rapidly during the early 1990s at Moscow State University. Many unofficial and partly fragmentary translations are in circulation. The first translation appearing in print was that by Kistyakovskij and Muravyov (volume 1, published 1982).\\n\\nNotable fan works by Russian writers, which often take the form of alternative accounts or informal sequels to Tolkien\\'s published works, include The Last Ringbearer (Последний кольценосец) by Kirill Eskov, and The Black Book of Arda (\"Чёрная Книга Арды\"). One of the authors of The Black Book of Arda derived her pen name from Nienna, the Vala Lady of Mercy: according to Mark T. Hooker, the work proved so influential in Russia following its 1992 release that \"Niennism\" emerged as a term used to describe both a \"distinctive literary turn and intellectual following\".\\n\\nJapan\\n\\nThe Hobbit appeared in a Japanese translation in 1965 (Hobitto no Boken) and The Lord of the Rings from 1972 to 1975 (Yubiwa Monogatari), both translated by Teiji Seta (1916–1979); they were revised by Seta\\'s assistant Akiko Tanaka in 1992. In 1982, Tanaka translated the Silmarillion (Sirumariru no Monogatari).\\nTeiji Seta was an expert in classical Japanese literature and a haiku poet, and the Tolkien scholar  regards the Seta and Tanaka translations as \"almost perfect\".\\n\\nGreece\\n\\nThe Hobbit and Lord of the Rings were published in Greek by Kedros during the 1970s, each by different translators. In the mid-90s Aiolos published Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales. In 2001, shortly before the release of the movies, the first Greek on-line community was formed in a promotional web site which in 2002 founded an official group of fans under the name The Prancing Pony. The group is unofficially divided in two \\'smials\\', in Athens and Thessaloniki.Greek Lord of the Rings Society\\n\\nBulgaria\\n\\nThe Bulgarian Tolkien Society was officially established in 1998 when the Bulgarian Tolkien Fan Club Rin Ennor was first registered as a non-profit non-governmental organization by a few students from the Sofia University. Apart from the larger communities in the big cities, the Bulgarian Tolkien Society has local clubs and groups.It is nowadays represented by the website https://www.endorion.org/ and the only remaining discussion board http://bgtolkienforum.org/\\n\\nTurkey\\n\\nInterest in Turkey awoke to The Lord of the Rings in the late 1980s, long before the first Turkish translation. A translation of The Lord of the Rings into Turkish was published as Yüzüklerin Efendisi in 1997. After the release of the movies, other Tolkien-related books such as The Silmarillion were translated into Turkish.\\n\\nPakistan\\n\\nInterest in Prof Tolkien\\'s work developed in Pakistan soon after its earliest inception as a separate nationSee Hall Mark: Burn Hall School Magazine Annual 1959, Review, p.15, published by the Burn Hall School, Abbottabad, Pakistan and has existed sporadically over the years. Interest grew manifold after the release and completion of the Lord of the Rings film trilogy and in 2003–04, the \\'Lahore Tolkien Reading Group\\' was established there.Affiliated with and reported in the Official Tolkien Society newsletter see http://www.tolkiensociety.org/ in the UK\\n\\n Italy \\n\\nThe Italian Tolkien Society (Società Tolkeniana Italiana - STI) was founded in February 1994, after a series of lectures about Tolkien\\'s thought and works made in Italy in 1992 by the Tolkien Society archivist, Patricia Reynolds, on the centenary of Tolkien\\'s birth. She stimulated the creation of the new society, of which she became a godmother. Priscilla Tolkien also became an honorary partner. During the years the society managed to grow enough to have hundreds of members and a lot of constant activities.\\nIt publishes two six-monthly magazines (Terra di Mezzo and Minas Tirith) and organizes two competitions for narrative and images (The Silmaril Awards), from which various publications (such as the volume Frammenti della Terra di Mezzo, a collection of the best stories) are derived. In collaboration with Italian national publishers it also publishes illustrated calendars whose beauty been recognized not only in Italy but internationally as well, for example by HarperCollins (Tolkien\\'s publishing house) that drawn some images from them for their book \"Realms of Tolkien\".\\nEvery year, in September, usually on its first weekend, they organize the Hobbiton, a great three-days feast with conferences, meetings, debates, concerts, dances, costume re-enactments, film screenings, treasure hunts and other Middle-Earth related activities. They also founded the Palantír publishing house.\\n\\nIn 2021, a pastry chef, Nicolas Gentile, bought a piece of land at Bucchianico in Abruzzo, and walked with friends in costume as the members of the Fellowship of the Ring to throw a ring into the crater of Mount Vesuvius. He has built a hobbit-style house and is seeking crowdfunding to build more. In his view, the people of the region \"have always lived as hobbits\" close to nature.\\n\\n References \\n\\n Sources \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n External links \\n\\n Tolkien societies\\n\\n Elanor – Flanders, Belgium\\n Bri – Denmark\\n Deutsche Tolkien Gesellschaft – Germany\\n Società Tolkeniana Italiana – Italy\\n Unquendor – Netherlands\\n Arthedain – Norway\\n Forodrim – Stockholm, Sweden\\n Seryn Ennor – Switzerland\\n The Tolkien Society – United Kingdom\\n The Mythopoeic Society site – United States\\n Magyar Tolkien Társaság – Hungary\\n Spoločenstvo Tolkiena – Slovakia\\n Orta Dünya – Turkey\\n Meneltarma – Romania\\n\\nCategory:Tolkien fandom',\n",

       " 'Colonel Rezin Hammond (1745–1809) was a United States revolutionary patriot and politician from Anne Arundel County, Maryland. He represented his county as a delegate at the Maryland Convention and later in the Maryland House of Delegates. Hammond served as a Colonel in the Anne Arundel County Militia during the American Revolution, and was known for his radical revolutionary views. He advocated publicly for extending voting privileges to all free men, regardless of their landholdings. Despite his progressive stance on voting rights, Hammond was a wealthy plantation owner who owned slaves.\\n\\n Biography \\nleft|thumb|Howard\\'s Adventure, childhood home of Rezin Hammond in Gambrills, Maryland\\nRezin Hammond was born into a politically influential family at Howard\\'s Adventure, their country home near Gambrills, Maryland. He was one of nine children born to Major Philip Hammond (1697–1760) and Rachel Brice Hammond (1711–1786). His maternal grandfather, John Brice Jr., was one of Maryland\\'s largest landowners, and Rezin was named after his paternal uncle. He would grow to be very close with his brother Mathias Hammond (1740–1786).\\n\\nFollowing in his father\\'s footsteps, Hammond became a planter and politician, representing the fourth generation of his family to enter politics. He would be elected to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 9th sessions of the Maryland Conventions, and took part in Maryland\\'s constitutional convention. Hammond later served in the Maryland House of Delegates for Anne Arundel County before resigning during the third session. As a politician, he was known for his opposition to English power and his advocacy for democratic reforms. From 1783 to 1785, he served as the commissioner of tax.\\n\\n Revolutionary activities \\nthumb|Rendering of the Burning of the Peggy Stewart by Francis Blackwell Mayer\\nRezin Hammond, along with his brother Mathias, became deeply involved in radical revolutionary politics. He served in the Anne Arundel County Militia and on the Annapolis Committee of Safety and Committee of Correspondence.https://npgallery.nps.gov/GetAsset/923ea801-52ff-4a80-ad5b-e7f01f8de211 An early advocate for independence, Hammond strongly opposed British taxation. In 1774, the Hammond brothers led Anne Arundel County radicals in denouncing the owners of the Peggy Stewart for violating the boycott on tea imports following the Tea Act of 1773. Their efforts culminated in a public meeting that led to the burning of the ship and its contents in Annapolis harbor. Hammond personally boarded the ship to set it alight.\\n\\nHammond was appointed lieutenant colonel for the Severn Battalion in 1776, and rose to the rank of colonel by 1795. He actively fought against the British during the Revolutionary War, and was highly regarded among Maryland revolutionaries: Colonel Edward Gaither of the Elk Ridge battalion bequeathed Hammond a horse and a sword in his will.The founders of Anne Arundel and Howard Counties, Maryland. A genealogical and biographical review from wills, deeds He was described as leading a \"little warrior band\" during the Revolutionary War, and had a sincere attachment to American independence.\\n\\nAt the Maryland Convention, Hammond led a radical faction alongside John Hall, known as the Hall-Hammond faction. They advocated for voting rights for all free taxpayers, regardless of property holdings.An American\\'s first essay, columns 1093 & 1094. A form of government proposed for the consideration of the citizens of Anne Arundel County. MSA SC 2221-4-2 June 1776. Maryland Gazette. This stance was controversial, especially given Hammond\\'s status as heir to one of Maryland\\'s largest landowners.Ronald Hoffman, A Spirit of Dissension: Economics, Politics, and the Revolution in Maryland (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1973) On August 15, 1776, an essay titled \"Watchman\" appeared in the Maryland Gazette arguing for universal male suffrage, which has been attributed to Hammond.\\n\\nThe essay, and the popular support behind it, had a significant impact on the convention. While property holdings remained a prerequisite for voting, the requirement was lowered and the holding of multiple offices was prohibited. \\n\\n Assassination attempt \\nOn April 25, 1791, Hammond survived an assassination attempt by Elijah Gaither, who had come to Hammond\\'s home with two pistols and a gun. One of Hammond\\'s slaves saved his life during the assault, and the assailant fled. Governor of Maryland John Eager Howard issued a proclamation in the Maryland Gazette for Gaither\\'s apprehension, and Hammond offered a substantial reward of four hundred dollars for his capture. \\n\\n Slave holdings \\nDespite his progressive views on voting rights, Hammond was a substantial slaveholder, who owned and used slaves to tend his vast property holdings. He inherited 12 slaves from his father\\'s estate in 1760, which increased to 72 slaves in 1783, and by 1798, he had become the second-largest slaveholder in the county. In 1794, he sent two slaves named Ben and Will to work several months at the Northampton Iron Works to \"improve their obedience\" and remove them from their connections. He is known to have freed several slaves during his lifetime, among them \"Negro Moses\" who would later be employed at the Maryland State House.\\n\\nAt the time of Hammond\\'s death, he owned 166 slaves, over 14,000 acres of property, and a law library. Although he provided for the manumission of his slaves in his will, this request was not honored by his heirs, and it took some of his former slaves decades to win their freedom.\\nthumb|329x329px|Burleigh Manor pictured in 1936\\n\\n Burleigh manor \\nIn the late 1790s and early 1800s, Hammond built Burleigh Manor, also known as \"Hammonds Inheritance\" in Ellicott City, Howard County, Maryland. The property, built on a 2,300-acre (930 ha) estate, is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Maryland. The house is fifteen miles west of Baltimore, Maryland. According to local folklore, the house was built for a prospective bride and family, which never took up residence. Hammond would share the home with his nephews and their families.\\n\\n Death \\nHammond never married, and died on September 1, 1809, at the age of 65. He was buried in the family plot at Howard\\'s Adventure. His obituary characterized him as an \"inflexible friend\" and \"upright citizen\". His substantial property holdings were distributed among his nephews, Denton Hammond and Matthias Hammond, and provisions were made for thirty-two of his former slaves in his will, which included land, weapons, horses and tools.\\n\\n External links \\n\\n \\n\\n References \\n\\nCategory:Continental Army officers from Maryland\\nCategory:Burials in Maryland\\nCategory:1809 deaths\\nCategory:1745 births\\nCategory:People from colonial Maryland\\nCategory:18th-century Maryland politicians\\nCategory:American revolutionaries\\nCategory:Plantation owners\\nCategory:American planters\\nCategory:American slave owners\\nCategory:Maryland militiamen in the American Revolution\\nCategory:18th-century American legislators\\nCategory:People of Maryland in the American Revolution\\nCategory:Colonial politicians from Maryland\\nCategory:Merchants from colonial Maryland',\n",

       " \"The Virovitica killings refers to the disappearances, torture and murder of Croatian Serb civilians in the town of  during the Croatian War of Independence.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nBy June 1991 tensions between ethnic Serbs and Croats broke out into full-scale war, which lasted until 1995. Virovitica is a town located in Slavonia, along the Drava river, near the Hungarian border. In 1991, the city recorded 16,167 inhabitants of which 11.7% were Serbs.\\n\\nCrimes\\nUnlike in the district of Gospić or in Sisak, the atrocities against Serbs in Virovitica were not as widespread. Beginning in the summer of 1991, however, numerous cases of crimes against civilians were recorded. The most notable instance concerns the case of Bogdan Mudrinić, who was taken from his home by members of the Croatian Army (HV). He was put in the military prison in Virovitica and beaten to death sometime between 11 and 13 December 1991. Afterwards, his body was taken out of the prison, where it was never since found. Ranko Mitrić, a physician, was taken from the hospital where he worked. On 1 November 1991, he was taken into custody by military police, charged with attacking a police officer. After being interrogated, he was handed over to police and then back to Croatian soldiers. The next day, he was killed and his body was thrown into a shaft that was then mined.\\n\\nFrom July to early September 1991, civilians Ranko Starović, Stevan Radlović, Slobodan Poplašen, and Mićo Petrović went missing. In December 1991, the elderly Milenko Momčilović was killed, his body still not been found. On 11 January 1992, Duško Šaponja was abducted, tortured and killed. He was shot with some 70 bullets, stabbed, disfigured, partially decapitated, then tied to a car and dragged to a local village where his body was found by factory workers. After his murder, one of the two culprits (Darko Pil) returned to the house and raped his wife. In April 1992, Vladimir Grubor was taken away from the village of Majkovac Podravski and never seen again. Apart from Mitrić and Šaponja, the bodies of the victims have never been found. The Serb National Council notes that these are only the documented cases of crimes and that there are more victims.\\n\\nTrials\\nIn April 1992, Darko Pil and Ivica Majetić, members of the Croatian Army, were sentenced to 15 and 12 years in prison respectively, by the Military Court in Bjelovar for the crime against Dusko Šaponja and his wife. Pil served six years while Majetić was pardoned by then-Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and sent to fight in the Bosnian War where he wound up losing both of his legs in action. In 2006, Pil was ordered to pay the widow of Šaponja, Dubravka Jagodić, 50,000 Kuna for raping her. Pil and Majetić were also ordered to compensate the family. However, nothing has been paid out Jagodić; Majetić's house was foreclosed in 2011. In turn, Jagodić was ordered to pay the costs of the lost litigation. Jagodić initiated a lawsuit against the state, requesting damages. After two first instance rulings in her favor, the Supreme Court rejected the compensation request, stating that the stature of limitations had run out.\\n\\nIn 2001, proceedings against four defendants, Željko Iharoš, Ivan Vrban, Anđelko Kašaj and Luka Perak, were initiated by the County Court in Bjelovar. They were charged for the murders of Mudrinić and Mitrić, as well as the physical assaults of civilians Rade Svorcan and Đuro Svorcan. In March 2006, they were acquitted, which was confirmed by the Supreme Court in 2009.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nCategory:1991 crimes in Croatia\\nCategory:Croatian war crimes in the Croatian War of Independence\\nCategory:History of the Serbs of Croatia\\nCategory:Mass murder in 1991\\nCategory:Mass murder in 1992\\nCategory:Mass murder in Croatia\",\n",

       " 'The Canadian Youth Congress was a left-wing youth movement that existed from 1935 until 1942, when it was declared illegal under the Defence of Canada Regulations. It was founded in Toronto in May 1935 as an organization to mobilize youths and youth-oriented organizations across Canada to lobby the government for change in the face of mass unemployment during the Great Depression in Canada. At its height, it had a constituent membership of over 400,000 and offices across the country and held annual congresses that attracted several hundred delegates. \\n\\nThe organization was part of the World Youth Congress Movement and sent delegates to the First World Youth Congress held in Geneva in 1936https://digitalcollections.mcmaster.ca/sites/default/files/pw20c_images/00000665-2.jpg and the Second World Youth Congress held at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York in 1938.https://digitalcollections.mcmaster.ca/pw20c/world-youth-congress-pamphlet-16-23-august-1938-0\\n\\nAt the 1936 Canadian Youth Congress national meeting in Ottawa, the group reported that it represented “men and women: youth from all the different religious denominations; from schools and universities; from the Y.M. and W.C.A.’s; from all political groupings; from different racial groups; from farms, factories, the professions; peace, cultural, athletic societies—English-speaking and French-speaking Canadians. The congress expressed the thought of awakened and intelligent youth opinion throughout our country”.\\n\\nIn 1936, the CYC\\'s Ottawa congress issued the Declaration of the Rights of Youth calling for youth employment training, public health care, social security, recreational and educational facilities, and world peace. Later in 1936, the CYC issued the Youth’s Peace Policy which stated that “war is not inevitable” and that “lasting peace can only be organized on a basis of justice” and calling on nations to adhere to the Covenant of the League of Nations. It called for Canada to make its own independent decisions in regards to war rather than automatically following the lead of the United Kingdom in foreign policy. \\n\\nAt its height, it was able to attract speakers at its conferences ranging from Tommy Douglas of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation to Paul Martin, Sr. of the Liberal Party of Canada and Denton Massey of the Conservatives, to Tim Buck of the Communist Party of Canada.\\n\\nIn 1940, after World War II had broken out, the CYC\\'s annual congress, held in Montreal, issued a declaration in support of civil liberties, stating that  “the War Measures Act and the Defence of Canada Regulations deny our traditional rights of free speech, free assembly, organization and trade union action, free press, radio and pulpit\" and also opposing conscription in Canada, in a statement title \\'\\'Youth Want Jobs Not Conscription\". \\n\\nThe organization as surveilled by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police as a suspected subversive organization, due to the involvement of the Young Communist League of Canada, which was a constituent organization of the CYC that would be been banned under the Defence of Canada Regulations in 1940. The RCMP claimed that of the 730 participants at the 1936 congress, 50 were members of the Young Communist League and a further 150 were \"straight Communists\" and claimed that 85% of participants at the 1940 congress were Communists. The CYC\\'s anti-war statements at its 1940 congress resulted in several organizations that supported the war effort withdrawing their affiliation with the CYC.

       " 'MyRadar is a free weather forecasting application developed and run by CEO Andy Green and his Orlando, Florida-based company ACME AtronOmatic (ACME).\\n\\nBeginning operations in 2008, the app for its first decade ran solely on free government-provided weather and radar data, but still became popular. To publish improved predictions of ongoing weather unique to the app, the first of many personal satellites was launched by the app in 2019. With funding to improve the apps radar and imaging notably coming from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Office of Naval Research (ONR), ACME was able to create a weather data satellite constellation named \"Hyperspectral Orbital Remote Imaging Spectrometer\" (HORIS), which runs off of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to create a current weather map. With the introduction of additional of features including the detection of wildfires and illegal fishing, the app has more broadly become an environmental intelligence app since 2022. In 2024, the app partnered with the Total Traffic and Weather Network (TTWN) to provide traffic flow and incident data for users with paying subscriptions via CarPlay and Android Auto, becoming one of the first weather apps to do so.\\n\\nThe app has received both positive and negative criticism since its launch, with positive criticism revolving around a number of the app\\'s features, and negative criticism revolving around the selling of users data.\\n\\n History \\nThe creator of the app, Andy Green, had created internet tech since the 1980s. His first major project was the development of a public access internet service company based in Rhode Island, which he later sold to finance the creation of ACME AtronOmatic (\"ACME\" for short), based in Orlando, Florida. The first major app created by ACME was called \"Flightwise\", which provided users with flight tracking information. In the summer of 2008, Green had the idea to use the animated location tracker already built-in to Flightwise to make a stand-alone weather forecasting app after wondering if a meal he was eating outdoors would get rained out. Despite running solely off of free government-provided weather and radar data for the first decade after launch, Green said the app \"took off like wildfire\" in downloads. In December 2017, the app partnered with \"TripIt\" to provide users with information about flight delays and gate changes, eliminating the need for a separate app like Flightwise.\\n\\nthumb|left|200px|alt=A small metal cube covered in electrical equipment|A close-up of a PocketQube satellite, which were launched by MyRadar and entered the atmosphere on 2 May 2022\\nIn 2019, ACME launched their first personal satellite for the app, a small prototype from New Zealand, as part of an effort to provide detailed imagery and improved predictions of ongoing weather unique to the app. More satellites were eventually launched by ACME to create a weather data satellite constellation named \"Hyperspectral Orbital Remote Imaging Spectrometer\" (HORIS), monitored by ground stations maintained by Kongsberg Satellite Services. HORIS operates MyRadar by taking the environmental data and imagery it collects and pairing it with machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to create a real-time weather map. Some AI elements of HORIS were taken from EndpointAI Inc., which ACME purchased in September 2020. In 2022, HORIS was expanded upon after ACME won approval from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to improve their satellite constellation to including 250 satellites or more. Main batch of satellites were PocketQubes, which entered the atmosphere on 2 May 2022 by Rocket Lab Electron launched also from New Zealand, with the additional purpose to test and validate the existing satellites in orbit. On 20 July 2022, the app partnered with the Allstate-owned company \"Arity\" to provide information about road conditions for drivers who share their location data. In October 2022, ACME received a  research grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to improve the app\\'s wildfire detection and air quality measurement technology to better detect smoke, aerosols, fire hotspots using satellites and aerial drones. On 20 July 2023, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) accepted a proposal by ACME to partner with the Space Science and Engineering Center (SSEC) to create a tool which more accurately predicts cloud representations for the app, which likewise was meant to benefit the Navy. On 18 August 2023, phase two of the NOAA grant was approved, providing an additional  to aid in the app\\'s aforementioned goals by launching a pair of CubeSat satellites to provide high definition infrared imagery. On 8 September 2023, the app secured another  in crowd funding to aid accomplishing the goals of the NOAA grant by expanding the app\\'s workforce from 35 to 100 employees by the end of 2024.\\n\\nIn January 2024, MyRadar partnered with Total Traffic and Weather Network (TTWN) to provide comprehensive traffic data overlayed with its pre-existing weather graphics for users in the United States. The partnership allowed for the app to additionally become a tool for navigation. This officially became a feature days later on 8 January 2024, when the app was made compatible with Apple\\'s CarPlay, becoming one of the first weather apps to gain this ability. On 7 February 2024, the Android equivalent Android Auto also gained the ability to display the app on car interfaces. In March 2024, the app launched a \"meteorological wedding planning service\" in the United States and Canada for prices between  and , in which users can request a personal meteorologist to provide an in-person meeting about the best dates for a wedding, and on-call local weather updates the day of. Also in March 2024, the app sponsored Kyle Weatherman and had a custom decal created for his No. 91 Chevy Camaro for the Focused Health 250 taking place in Austin, Texas. In July 2024, the app launched a sweepstakes for one user to join a team of two professional storm chasers during the 2025 tornado season.\\n\\n Features and general information \\nthumb|200px|alt=The central dashboard of a car displaying a screen with multiple apps on it|MyRadar became one of the first weather apps able to be used hands-free on CarPlay\\nThe app\\'s primary function is to provide weather forecasting and prediction to users. The app includes toggleable options to track and send alerts to users for rain, wind patterns, earthquakes, tornadoes, tropical cyclones, wildfires, and more. In early 2020, a feature was added to track orbital objects such as the International Space Station. In May 2022, with the imagery improvement of HORIS, the app gained the secondary abilities to better monitor algae blooms, coral reefs, illegal fishing, and wildfires. In July 2022, a feature called \"MyDrives\" was added which provides drivers with weather conditions on the road, and likewise routes to avoid inclement weather. In January and February 2024, the ability to display traffic flow and incident data in a feature called \"RouteCast\" was added, and can be displayed in video and 3D options via CarPlay and Android Auto for users with paying subscriptions. The app also provides annual tropical storm and tornado outlooks for their respective seasons, gathered through satellite and ariel drone data, as well as through on the ground storm chasers. The app is free, but does offer in-app purchases for additional material like some of those listed above.\\n\\nThe app is headquartered on 111 W. Jefferson Street, Suite 200 in Orlando, Florida. The founder and CEO is Andy Green, the Chief Scientist and Chief Technology Officer is Sarvesh Garimella, and the senior meteorologist is Matthew Cappucci. Users are only able to download the app in Australia, Canada, Japan, and the United States, but the app is available in nine languages: being Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish.\\n\\n Reception and criticism \\nThe app has more than fifty million downloads, and has an active userbase of around fifteen million across iOS, Android, and Windows devices in 2024. In 2020, the app was regarded by the newspaper Florida Trend as \"one of the top radar and weather prediction smartphone apps\". In 2024, the New York Post criticized the app for sending user data to the AllState-owned company Arity, who MyRadar had partnered with in 2022, which uses data such as speeding and sudden braking to impact car insurance rates of the user.\\n\\n References \\n\\nCategory:Free application software\\nCategory:Geographic data and information software\\nCategory:Mobile applications\\nCategory:Weather forecasting',\n",

       " 'Viliam Žingor (30 July 1912 – 18 December 1950) was a Slovak partisan, one of the leaders of the Slovak National Uprising.\\n\\n Early life \\nViliam Žingor was born on 30 July 1912 in the village of Bystrička, Turóc County, Austria-Hungary to a Lutheran family. He started his education at the local school and in 1930 he graduated from a Gymnasium in the town of Martin.\\n\\nŽingor studied for two years, but did not graduate, at the Mendel University in Brno. Instead of finishing his studies, he married young, had four children and helped at the family farm. Later he held several clerical and sales jobs. In his early adulthood, Žingor received basic military training during his military military service with the artillery regiment in Žilina. At this time, he supported the Slovak National Party and advocated for autonomy of Slovakia within Czechoslovakia, but not its independence.\\n\\nWhen Slovakia declared independence as a satellite of Nazi Germany, Žingor joined the fascist militia Hlinka Guard. He later explained this association as a part of the effort of the antifascists in his village to sabotage the organization from within. He briefly studied at the officer school in Bratislava and reached the rank of lieutenant.   Afterwards, Žingor worked as a manager of a bookstore confiscated by the writer Ľudo Ondrejov from the Steiners, a Jewish family.\\n\\n Partisan activities \\nŽingor fought with the Slovak army in the short Slovak–Hungarian War in 1939 and in 1941 on the Eastern Front near the Ukrainian city of Lypovets as an artillery commander. According to his later testimony, Žingor fought the Hungarians in 1939 but avoided direct combat against Soviet troops and used his time in the Soviet Union to learn about the insurgency against Nazi troops. After several months at the front, he returned to Slovakia.\\n\\nOn 4 July 1943, Žingor received an order to return to the front as a part of a Slovak forces detachment set to reinforce the Axis troops at the Eastern Front. This time, Žingor ignored the order and instead hid in the mountains close to his home village. Over the course of the spring of 1944, he organized fellow deserters into a partisan group. During the following the summer, the newly formed group trained new recruits and gathered weapons and supplies. In August 1944, Žingor\\'s group made contact with another partisan group established in the vicinity of a nearby village of Sklabiňa by the Soviet officer Pyotr Alexievich Velichko.\\n\\nVelichko was dispatched to Slovakia by the command of the Soviet Army to organize resistance in Slovakia. Žingor was tasked by the resistance command to support Velichko. As a result of these developments, Žingor was given command of the Slovak unit within the 1st Czechoslovak Brigade. Nonetheless, relations between the two commanders quickly deteriorated. The cooling of relations was largely caused by the incident when partisans under the command of Velichko raided Sklabiňa and massacred over 140 locals suspected of being of German nationality of otherwise supporting the regime.\\n\\nThe partisan group under Žingor\\'s command continued growing in size. At its peak it counted about 1,500 men. Among the new fighters was number of French captives who formed a unit under the Brigade under the command of captain Georges Barazer de Lannurien. As the time passed Žingor formed a close bond with de Lannurien. At the same time, Žingor\\'s relationship with Velichko reached a critical point, in particular due to the Soviet commander\\'s brutal methods and tolerance for looting. To ease the tensions, the resistance command ordered the creation of a separate 2nd Czechoslovak Brigade under Žingor\\'s command.\\n\\nAfter the outbreak of the Slovak National Uprising, the Brigade was in charge of the defense of the Rajec basin. The Brigade fought valiantly, being the only partisan grouping capable of holding ground against German forces without the assistance from insurgent units from the regular army. Nonetheless, the Brigade suffered massive casualties, which included Žingor\\'s brother Bohuš. Following the defeat of the Uprising, the remains of the brigade, consisting of about 300 men, retreated to the mountains and limited its activities to defensive operations due to the critical shortage of equipment. The survivors eventually joined the advancing Soviet forces.\\n\\n After the war \\nAfter the end of the war, Žingor was awarded the Order of the Slovak National Uprising, 1st class and repeatedly promoted eventually reaching the rank of Mayor. He accepted the invitation of Karol Bacílek to became a member of the Communist Party of Slovakia. In the 1946 Czechoslovak parliamentary election he was elected MP. Until 1947 he also served as the deputy commander of the newly formed police force, Sbor národní bezpečnosti, for Central Slovakia and the chair of the Union of Slovak Partisans. During the trial of the fascist president of Slovakia Jozef Tiso he was a part of delegation of former partisans threatening to cause disorder if Tiso is not sentenced to death.\\n\\nIn spite of his career rise, Žingor quickly became dissatisfied with the political developments. He was politically upset by sidelining of former partisans at the expense of various well-connected individuals, who were unknown to the resistance movement during the war but suddenly claimed they had played crucial role in the anti-fascist struggle. Politically, he found himself in agreement with the opposition Democratic Party, rather than the Communists. In 1947 he left the Communist party.\\n\\n Persecution and death \\nŽingor\\'s persecution started right after the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d\\'état in February 1948.  The new communist regime was irritated by Žingor\\'s popularity as a partisan commander and his closeness to the Democratic Party as well as his insistence on keeping the Union of Slovak Partisans apolitical. On 5 March 1948, he was stripped of his parliament mandate. He was also relieved from all his official function.\\n\\nIn response to the prosecution, Žingor hid in a woods cabin owned by a fellow partisan Vlastislav Kováč together with Elena Lamošová, a woman Žingor got involved with after the breakdown of his marriage, who was pregnant with twins and her son from a previous relationship. Nonetheless, they were betrayed by the midwife they called to assist with the birth of the twins. Žingor was arrested on 27 November 1947 and accused of being a \"mercenary in service of Capitalism\" as well as a follower of Titoism, a common accusation at the time of the Tito–Stalin split. According to the usual practice imported from the Soviet Union, the trial with Žingor was proceeded by organized letters of his friends, co-workers. The Ministry of Justice published a pamphlet Red Hemingway written by Ladislav Mňačko, a fellow partisan, in which he accused Žingor of being a traitor to the Slovak National Uprising. Other formed partisan commanders also joined the ranks of the accusers, although some later claimed their signatures under a letter denouncing Žingor were fake. Žingor himself was tortured and forced to admit all his crimes and ideological sins.\\n\\nŽingor was sentenced to death for treason and espionage after a three-day show trial on 21 October 1950. He stood accused alongside about 30 other \"capitalists, landlords and traitors\", including two other commanders of the 2nd Czechoslovak Brigade, Samuel Bibza and Ladislav Nosák, who also received death sentences. The execution by hanging took place on 18 December 1950 in Bratislava. Žingor\\'s last hours were later described by the Lutheran pastor Ondrej Bartko who tended to him before the execution.\\n\\n Rehabilitation and legacy \\nThe process of Žingor\\'s rehabilitation was started in 1968, due to the shifting political climate caused by the Prague Spring. A court in Banská Bystrica ruled Žingor and his fellow accused were innocent. Nonetheless, the process was put on hold after the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. Only after the return to democracy following the Velvet Revolution was Žingor fully rehabilitated, posthumously promoted to the rank of Brigadier General by the president Václav Havel and awarded the Milan Rastislav Stefanik Order, 3rd class.\\n\\n References \\n\\nCategory:1912 births\\nCategory:1950 deaths\\nCategory:People executed by the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic by hanging\\nCategory:Executed Slovak people\\nCategory:Communist Party of Czechoslovakia politicians\\nCategory:Slovak partisans\\nCategory:Slovak generals\\nCategory:People from Martin District',\n",
       " 'Samding Dorje Phagmo Deqinquzhen (Chinese: 桑顶· 多吉帕姆· 德钦曲珍; born February 8, 1942, according to the Tibetan calendar) is the only living female Buddha in China to have the title of Great Khutuktu. She holds a high status in Tibetan Buddhism\\'s history. The 12th Samding Dorje Phagmo Deqinquzhen is regarded in Tibetan Buddhism as the embodiment of the Buddha mother who gave birth to every Buddha.\\n\\n Birth \\nDeqingquzhen\\'s father, Rendian Jiebu, is a manor housekeeper. Prophecies predicted that a living female Buddha would come to Rendian Jeb\\'s family as early as before her birth. Deqingquzhen got a severe illness shortly after her birth. After begging the gods for help, she was sent to Lhasa Lun Nun Temple. That year, Sangding Monastery came to choose the living Buddha. She recognized the item used by the previous female living Buddha. Then, on February 8, 1947, an auspicious day according to the Tibetan calendar, Deqinquzhen was welcomed into the Samding Monastery by monks and other people dancing and singing Buddhist hymns. Then, the succession ceremony was held, and she formally became the 12th Doje Phagmo Living Buddha.\\n\\n Life \\nDeqinquzhen spent her childhood worshipping the Buddha, chanting sutras, and practicing Buddhism, and many eminent monks have tutored her. However, when the local government of Tibet staged a riot in March 1959, with the Samding Monastery at its center, the rioters intruded into the monastery many times, demanding firearms and food. The Living Buddha and several of her servants escaped from the Samding Monastery and hid on the island in the center of the Yamdrok Tso Lake, but they were found afterward. \"Escorted\" by the armed rioters, the living Buddha had to leave Tibet.\\n\\nDeqinquzhen was first taken to Bhutan and then to India, and in August 1959, the 12th Dorje Palmo was assisted by a Chinese commercial organization in Kalimpong. She traveled to Pakistan through Afghanistan, Russia, and Mongolia before finally arriving in Beijing at the end of September, just before the National Day Ceremony, completing a six-month migration to a foreign country. When she was abroad, she claimed that she missed her homeland, Tibet, a lot.\\n\\nIn the 1980s, Sangding Monastery was rebuilt, and the Deqinquzhen resumed the annual Gangjasa puja. She eventually chose to stay in Lhasa and practice at home, and the yearly grand “Gangjasa” puja was the only chance for the disciples to see her. After leaving Sangding Monastery, Dechen Chögyam established his family and regained a secular life.\\n\\n Once-in-a-lifetime “alchemy” ritual \\nLiving female Buddha Deqinquzhen completed her once-in-a-lifetime “alchemy” ceremony in 1994. Living Buddhas preside over the “Flower Dew Pill Ceremony,\" a common religious activity in Tibetan Buddhist temples. However, the female living Buddha only does it once in each lifetime. In 1994, the female living Buddha in the Sangdeng temple held a grand “flower dew pill alchemy” ceremony, finally completing her long-cherished wish for many years. There are tens of thousands of believers who came from faraway. Female living Buddha\\'s “alchemy” ceremony lasted nearly half a month. People held the precious pills and offered khat to the female living Buddha, wishing her success.\\n\\n References \\n\\nCategory:1942 births\\nCategory:Living people\\nCategory:Chinese Buddhists',\n",

       " \"Gonzalo Brenes, sometimes given as Gonzalo Brenes Candanedo, (May 18, 1907, David, Chiriquí – January 5, 2003, Chiriquí Province, Panama) was a Panamanian composer, musicologist, civil servant, politician and educator. He was known for his work collecting and publishing Panamanian folk music. His compositions blended Panamanian folk songs with European classical musical. He served a term in the National Assembly of Panama, and from 1953 to 1960 he was Panama's Secretary of Culture. He taught at several institutions in Panama, including serving as the  Advisory Director of Panama's National Institute of Music.\\n\\nEarly life and education\\nThe son of Don Agustín Brenes and Aurora Candanedo Gutiérrez, Gonzalo Brenes Candanedo was born on May 18, 1907, in David, Chiriquí, Panama. He studied piano is his youth with a variety of teachers and began his higher education studies in music at the  after winning a music scholarship through a performance competition in 1923. There he was a pupil of Dr. José Dolores Moscote with whom he studied music until he graduated in 1927. He pursued further studies at the Leipzig Conservatory (now the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig) in Germany where he was a pupil of composer Sigfrid Karg-Elert. He studied for four years at the conservatory from 1927 until his graduation in 1931. There he learned to speak German, and was heavily influenced by the music at St. Thomas Church, Leipzig which he attended regularly while in that city. He also made the acquaintance of composers Richard Strauss and Igor Stravinsky during his time in Germany.\\n\\nComposer and researcher\\nBrenes was highly impacted by his studies with Karg-Elert who emphasized the importance of using folk music as a source of inspiration for music composition in keeping with his own ideas of nationalism as it impacted music composition. Karg-Elert encourgaged Brenes to examine the music of his own people and culture to inspire his music composition writing, and accordingly his music composition writing while studying under Karg-Elert embraced Panamanian music forms like saloma, cumbia, and tamborito in combination with classical European music. This interest in Panamanian music blossomed further in Brenes's later career as a musicologist and folk song collector. His passion for Panamanian music was further reinforced after Brenes returned to Panama in 1931 when he read Narciso Garay’s Tradiciones y cantares de Panamá.\\n\\nBrenes did extensive musicology research in the Los Santos and Herrera provinces of Panama. He collected folk music of that region which led to the publication of his book Desarrollo musical de Panamá a partir de la República (Panama City) and the folk song collection Tondas del trópico niño (Panama City, 1955) which included 70 of the Panamanian songs from his research. This latter work became widely used in public school music education programs in Panama, and some of these songs were performed and recorded by professional musicians. His research also influenced his composition writing, including his opera La cucarachita mandinga which used a libretto by Rogelio Sinan.\\n\\nEducator and politician\\nIn addition to his work as a researcher, Brenes was also active as an educator and politician.  He began his teaching career on the staff of the Instituto Panamericano in his native city in 1931 where he taught both music and history for one year. He then taught at both the Normal School of Teachers (Spanish: La Escuela Normal de Institutoras) and the National Institute of Panama after being appointed to the faculties of those schools by Panama's president Harmodio Arias Madrid. Those positions were obtained partly through his political connections as an active member of the Agrarian Party.\\n\\nWhen Juan Demóstenes Arosemena succeeded Arias Madrid as Panama's president, Brenes's employment changed, and he taught at the  from 1938 to 1940. From 1940 to 1943 he again taught in his native city of David, and from 1943 to 1947 he worked as a music educator in Costa Rica. At the request of Costa Rican writer and politician  he founded and served as music director of a choir made up of Costa Rican laborers and Costa Ricans living in poverty. In 1948 he taught in Mexico where he befriended musicologist Adolfo Salazar and composers Rodolfo Halffter, Luis Sandi, and Manuel Ponce.\\n\\nIn 1949 Brenes returned to his hometown of David after being offered a position as associate editor of the newspaper Ecos del Valle.

       " \"The Mexico City-Querétaro electric passenger train () was a passenger train that provided services in central Mexico. During its 2 years of existence (1994-96), it was operated by Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México.\\n\\n History \\n\\n Background \\nThe oldest antecedents of this railroad date back to the concessions granted by the government of President Porfirio Díaz for the construction of the Mexican Central Railway, which used both American and Mexican capital. The Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway provided the American capital, while the federal government of Mexico provided the Mexican capital. The base concession allowed the construction of a line between Mexico City and Ciudad Juárez, which was opened. in 1884. In 1888, a branch was added to the Pacific Ocean via the cities of Guadalajara and Querétaro.\\n\\nIn 1908, at the end of the Porfirian government, the state-owned Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México was created, which constituted the first nationalization of strategically valuable railroads in Mexican history. This nationalization was achieved by expropriating and merging the Mexican Central, National and International railroads, along with other smaller companies. The resulting company controlled  of nationalized railroads. Between 1910 and 1929, the state of these lines was uncertain, as they fell into the hands of the different groups that fought during the Mexican Revolution.\\n\\n First proposals for electrification \\nThe Mexican government's Railroad Development Plan 1973-1986 () had, among other project, proposed the construction of an electrified Mexico City-Tijuana double-track railroad for the transport of cargo and passengers. In 1978, the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation planned the construction of the first Mexican double-track electric railroad fed by catenary. Based on a study prepared by that government agency, it was determined that the Mexico City-Querétaro route was the most viable to electrify. due to its high influx of passengers and cargo, almost slopeless topography, and strategic location in the center of the country.\\nthumb|295x295px|Current situation of the line, as of 2024\\nIn 1979, as part of the construction work, the Mexican government included Japanese, English and French participation in the project. The locomotives used were the GE E60C-2, which were designed and assembled by the GE Transportation company in Aguascalientes between 1980 and 1982.\\n\\nAround 1983, the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation decided to suspend the project due to changes in the layout of the routes and the operating policies. In 1986, electrification was restarted only with the participation of technical staff from the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation, Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México, and the French Société Francais d’Etudes et de Réalisations Ferroviaires.\\n\\nDuring the construction of the track that lasted from 1983 to 1994, the construction of a railway like the Shinkansen on the same right-of-way was considered in 1987, but the lack of funds made it unfeasible. For this reason, the construction of the electrified tracks for mixed service continued.\\n\\n Operation \\nOn 14 February 1994, regular electric trips between the Buenavista station in Mexico City and Querétaro began. The service only lasted until 1996 with a poor result, because the electric locomotives could not run at full speed, since they had to share the tracks with diesel-electric locomotives. The restriction of the E60C-2s to serve only on this line made them unaffordable.\\n\\n End of operations \\nIn 1996, President Ernesto Zedillo disincorporated the state-owned company Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México, and passenger transport operations throughout most of the country were terminated.\\n\\nAfter the railroad network was privatized again in 1997, Transportación Ferroviaria Mexicana decided to sell the 39 GE E60C-2 locomotives to American companies, ending the use of electrified track, leaving the electrified catenary lines for supposed use in the future. 22 of the locomotives were traded back to GE Transportation in exchange for GE AC4400CW diesel locomotives. Three of those were then sold to Texas Utilities for use on electrified freight trains. Meanwhile, the TFM sold 6 more E60C-2s to the Black Mesa and Lake Powell Railroad.\\n\\n Later use of electric infrastructure \\nSome of the overhead lines on this line would later be reused for the Tren Suburbano, an electrified commuter train between Mexico City's new Buenavista railway station and Cuautitlán.\\n\\n References \\n*\\n\\n See also \\n\\n Rail transport in Mexico\\n Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México\\nCategory:Rail transportation in Mexico\",\n",
       " 'Godlief Rudolf Pantouw (born 30 October 1910) was an Indonesian politician and businessman of Minahasan descent. He served in the cabinet of the State of East Indonesia as minister of social affairs and minister of information in 1947. He was also active in the Indonesian nationalist movement, having been a member of various youth organizations. He later became a lecturer at Hasanuddin University.\\n\\n Early life and career \\nGodlief Rudolf Pantouw was born in Manado, a city in present-day North Sulawesi, on 30 October 1910. He was active in the  youth organization and was one of its delegates to the second Youth Congress held on 27–28 October 1928. Pantouw was also active in the  association. During the 1930s, he worked as a teacher at the Pergoeroean Rakjat-School () in Makassar. However, he was suspended and later banned from teaching by the Dutch East Indies government for having disturbed security and order. In 1938, he stood for a seat in the Manado Gemeenteraad (municipal council).\\n\\n Independence struggle \\n\\nPantouw joined another organization in Makassar, Syukai Gi In, before it changed its name to Sumburan Darah Rakyat (Sudara, ) following the surrender of Japan and the proclamation of Indonesian independence. Despite being active in organizations like Sudara and the People\\'s Sovereignty Party, Pantouw decided to collaborate with the Dutch after realizing an inability to achieve much with the former. He joined the first cabinet of the Dutch-backed State of East Indonesia (Negara Indonesia Timur, NIT) in 1947, becoming minister of information under Prime Minister Nadjamuddin Daeng Malewa, a fellow nationalist.\\n\\nAs a minister, Pantouw was mainly concerned with tackling the social problems facing the Indonesian people. He was aware of the NIT\\'s reputation as a Dutch puppet state, but was determined to use the state as a tool to push the Dutch into abandoning colonialism. He argued that \"it was impossible for the newly proclaimed Republic of Indonesia — which had no power, no army, and no weapons in this part of the country — to fight the Dutch effectively\" therefore joining the NIT was essential to advance the cause of Indonesian independence given the political conditions at the time. The revolution eventually came to an end in 1949, but nationalists continued their goal of disbanding the NIT and re-establishing a unitary state. The Makassar Uprising accelerated reunification talks and the NIT was dissolved into the republic in 1950.\\n\\n Later career \\nPantouw became a lecturer at the Djakarta Journalist Academy in the 1950s, together with Parada Harahap and Sitor Situmorang.

       " 'On February 12, 1971, Patricia Ann Mann, age 19 and Jesse Allen McBane, age 20, were found brutally murdered in the woods of Orange County, North Carolina. The murders, known as \"The Valentine\\'s Day Murders\", have to this day never been solved. Police have permanently reopened the investigation since 2011, and have requested in recent years for the public to come forward with any and all needed information.\\n\\nVictims\\nPatricia Ann Mann, the youngest of four children, was a nursing student from Sanford, doing her residential training at Watts Hospital in Durham. Jesse Allen McBane was a North Carolina State University athletic student from Pittsboro in his freshman year. McBane\\'s class voted him \"Most Likely to Succeed\". The couple started dating in high school, eventually getting engaged in the weeks before the murders.\\n\\nMurder\\nOn February 12, 1971, Mann and McBane left a Valentine\\'s Day dance they attended together at Watts Hospital. Mann, accompanied by McBane, signed out of her dorm and planned to return by the 1am curfew. Their families and Mann\\'s roommates went to police when they didn\\'t return that night. On February 16, McBane\\'s friend found his brother Marty\\'s car the couple left in at a lover\\'s lane at Wayside Place. The car was locked, and it appeared to be wiped of fingerprints. Two coats and Mann\\'s folded pantyhose were found inside the car.\\n\\nOn February 24, a surveyor in Duke Woods, three miles away from the lane, found Mann and McBane dead, tied to a tree and covered in leaves and debris. Their causes of death were determined to be asphyxiation, from ropes, which were even then still tied to both of them, being repeatedly tightened and released around each of their necks. Mud on their shoes indicated they were alive for the extent of the violence, which was estimated to have lasted some hours before the couple died. Examinations also revealed that had multiple stab wounds to their chests, which were postmortem, and Mann\\'s liver was ruptured from what was determined to be a punch to her stomach.\\n\\nInvestigation and Legacy\\nSgt. Tim Bowers of the Durham Police Department was first assigned the investigation, shortly after his promotion. He solicited New York criminal psychologist Dr. James Brussel to create a profile of the killer. Multiple agencies became involved in the case, including the Orange County Sheriff\\'s Office, Durham Sheriff\\'s Office, The North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, and the North Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles. There\\'s an agreement the killer(s) met Mann and McBane before the murders, let alone the killings were planned and the killer was familiar with the location. The case went cold in part to difficulties and apprehension between different departments\\' and offices\\' investigations, as well as struggles to narrow in on suspects.\\n\\nFor a while after that, locals avoided the woods where Mann and McBane were found, preventing people they knew from going into the woods, such as their children when they wanted to play, out of the fear they would also be harmed. In the following year of 1972, as would later be publicized, another couple was attacked by a gunman who tried to kidnap them Duke Forest by forcing them into the trunk of his car. The man fought the attacker, who pistol-whipped him violently enough the victim was left with lasting nerve damage. The couple nevertheless escaped, and the gunman fled. The case was assigned to a now-retired State Bureau agent, who would provide the case file and other evidence to later investigations, including a composite sketch of the suspect.  Then in 1995, anonymous called confessed to the murders to Mann\\'s and McBane\\'s families. The call was traced to have been placed a mile from where the couple was found dead.\\n\\nIn 2011, Mann\\'s cousin, Carolyn Spivey, who married McBane\\'s best friend David by then, called to ask if there were any updates. This was around the same time Major Tim Horne of the Orange County Sheriff\\'s Office found discarded evidence when Sheriff Lindy Pendergrass was planning a renovation at the local jail. The case has since been reopened, Horne and Sheriff\\'s Office Investigator Dawn Hunter acting as the leading investigators of the case. Horne ensured his involvement by extending his retirement to the end of 2018 to provide attention and effort to the investigation. The department tried to use M-VAC System technology, having one of only a hundred machines in existence and forty in the nation alone, to collect DNA from the ropes and other evidence. No viable samples for testing against suspects were recovered.

       " 'thumb|Indian postal stamp showing Lord Rama stringing the divine bow Pinaka at the Sita Swayamvara Shabha in Mithila.\\nSita Swayamvara (Maithili: सीता स्वंवर) is a popular event in the history of the epic Ramayana in the Indian subcontinent. The event was related to a competition among the kings in the subcontinent to get an offer for marrying with the princess Sita of the Mithila Kingdom. The competition of the Sita Swayamvara was organised at the court of the King Shreedhwaja Janaka in Mithila.\\n\\n Background \\n\\nAccording to the scriptures of Hinduism, the divine bow Pinaka of Lord Shiva was given to Devarata Janaka of Mithila for its safe-keeping. That bow Pinaka of Lord Shiva was safe till the King Shreedhwaja Janaka as his heritage. It is said that the bow was such a powerful that no one was able to uplift it. There is a story that once princess Sita had lifted this bow in her childhood. When the King Janaka saw the princess Sita uplifting the divine bow Pinaka, he was impressed by her power and then he thought that she was no ordinary maiden.\\n\\nAfter King Janaka thought that princess Sita should marry to a more powerful man who can uplift and break the bow. Therefore, when the princess Sita later grew up and became eligible for marriage, then the King Janaka organised Swayamvara Shabha at his court for the selection of bridegroom to the princess Sita. In the Swayamvara Shabha, the King Janaka put a condition among the participating kings that to become bridegroom of the princess Sita one had to uplift and break the divine bow Pinaka.\\n\\n Description \\nIn different versions of Ramayana, there are some slight differences in the stories of the Sita Swayamvara. In the Ramayana serial of Ramanand Sagar, Sita Swayamvara ceremony is depicted as a single day ceremony at the court of King Janaka in which all the kings or princes of the kingdoms in the entire Aryavarta were invited. But according to some scholars and legends the Sita Swayamvara Shabha ceremony was not organised for a single day but for many different days.\\n\\nAccording to legend, there is also a story of participation of King Ravan without any invitation. In the story Banashur, the Shabhapati of the assembly for swayamvara, asked introduction with the King Ravana, then Ravana became very angry with him. The dialogue between King Ravana and Banashur  is popularly known as Ravana-Banashur Samvada. It is said that Ravana tried to uplift the divine bow of Lord Shiva forcefully there but was not able to uplift the bow. He even failed to move the divine bow a little bit. It is said that princess Sita was also not interested from her heart to adopt Ravana as her life partner. Then he returned from there after being humiliated with the public present in the assembly. According to Shree Ramcharitmanas, the reason behind the failure of Ravana at the Swayamvar Sabha was his proudness of power. It took love, not power, to uplift the bow. The eligibility and virtues of a person to uplift the divine bow were being kind, soft-spoken, gracious and far from ego. Before and after the King Ravana, many other powerful kings and princes tried to uplift the divine bow but no one was able to uplift the bow by their powers.\\n\\n Arrival of princes Rama and Lakshmana \\n\\nIt is said that Guru Vishwamitra received invitation from the King Janaka to come in the Sita Swayamvara Shabha. After receiving the invitation, Guru Vishwamitra along with his disciples Rama and Lakshmana went to the Kingdom of Mithila. After few days they reached at the court of King Janaka where Sita Swayamvara Shabha was organised. In the Swayamvar Sabha, when all the kings and princes became unsuccessful in uplifting the divine bow, then Guru Vishwamitra directed his disciple Rama to uplift the divine bow.\\n\\nIt is said that the prince Rama first bowed to the divine bow Pinaka of Lord Shiva and then tried to lift it with the same ease and humility as princess Sita. His spirit succeeded and he was able to uplift the divine bow easily. After that he broke the bow. Then princess Sita came to prince Rama. She garlanded him with her swayamvara garland and accepted Lord Rama as her life partner.\\n\\n Legacy \\nIn the modern times the Sita Swayamvara ceremony is still played and shown in dramas, theatre and Ramleela, etc. at different parts of the Indian subcontinent. In 2016, Siya Ke Ram television serial of Star Plus made special and grand episodes on the topic Sita Swayamvara. They also launched 15 days Dhanush Yatra that traveled 107 major cities of India accross Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Punjab, etc for the awareness of the popular epic event \"Sita Swayamvara\" in Ramayana.\\n\\n References \\n\\nCategory:Ramayana\\nCategory:Mithila\\nCategory:Hinduism',\n",

The founder and coordinator of LIMA Taiwan Indigenous Youth Working Group, which works to increase Indigenous youth outreach and foster connections with their international counterparts.\\n\\nShe was selected as the leading candidate for the Democratic Progressive Party\\'s party list ahead of the 2020 Taiwanese legislative election, but was removed from the list altogether with the party citing her previous associations with the Kuomintang and her lack of political experience. In addition to her work as an activist and diplomat, Tuhi worked as an editor, translator, and anchor for Taiwan Indigenous Television, focusing on international news, as well as a board member for the Taiwan Legal Aid Foundation and as an instructor for the University of Taipei.\\n\\nEarly life and education\\nMartukaw was born as Hung Chien Ting-Hui 1985 in , a segment within the city of Taitung to a Hoklo father and a Pinuyumayan mother. In typical Hoklo fashion, she was given a four character Chinese name. Whereas the name \"Tuhi Martukaw\" honours her maternal grandmother, who had died prior to when she was born. In the Puyuma naming system, names are given from deceased elders and are given to the individual once they have grown up.\\n\\nWhile raised in an Indigenous community, Tuhi was unable to speak the Puyuma language. Tuhi recalled an instance while attending the UNPFII conference in 2006 where she was unable to speak on any issues regarding her Indigenous background compared to her peers. When she returned to Taiwan, she researched Indigenous movements and spent time in her home community during a period of mourning for her maternal grandfather.\\n\\nMartukaw received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Diplomacy from National Chengchi University and a Master of Arts degree in European Studies at the University of Hamburg. It was through her work at the Department of Diplomacy where she was able to participate in the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and build the framework for the development of the LIMA Taiwan Indigenous Youth Working Group.\\n\\nCareer\\nTuhi works as a board member of the Taipei Legal Aid Foundation and as an instructor at the University of Taipei. A journalist, she works as an editor and news anchor for Taiwan Indigenous Television. She works as an international news translator for the channel, she currently works as a freelance journalist and a member of the Indigenous Media Caucus.\\n\\nTuhi is recognized as a leader of the Taiwanese delegation to the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII), having attended meetings for ten years consecutively starting in 2006, she was selected as co-chair of the Global Indigenous Youth Caucus from 2010 to 2015, which was recognized by the UNPFII. She recalled the difficulty in organizing fellow youth, only having the caucus recognized in 2008. At the United Nations, Tuhi works collaboratively with international Indigenous groups to expand international participation for the Indigenous peoples of Taiwan despite Taiwan\\'s complicated legal situation. Oftentimes, the Taiwanese delegation requires \"borrowing\" from the resources of allied organizations due to the political status of Taiwan.\\n\\nTuhi is the founder and the coordinator of the LIMA Taiwan Indigenous Youth Working Group. Established in 2013, the group works to train and connect Indigenous youth with their counterparts internationally, to contribute in their struggle of attaining rights, and building up capacity in carrying on cultural heritage, equality, and justice. The group additionally works to boost public understanding and increase visibility of issues related to the Taiwanese Indigenous community. LIMA was involved in the Sunflower Student Movement of 2014, holding Indigenous Youth forums on the site of the protest. Prior to attending annual trips to the UNPFII, Tuhi organizes workshops around the country to enhance awareness of global and local Indigenous rights issues.\\n\\nActivism\\nTuhi\\'s activism focuses on the areas of climate change, Indigenous feminism, land issues, and the participation of Indigenous youth in global affairs. Tuhi urged the UNPFII\\'s official translation to remove the term \"土住\" from its name, criticizing China\\'s decision on the matter and the pejorative nature of the term in Indigenous communities. She was critical of the United Nations for failures in reporting on the condition of Taiwanese Indigenous peoples, requesting the UN conduct surveys on the sexual violence on Indigenous Taiwanese women and the self-harm and suicide rates of Indigenous youth. Tuhi urged the body to approach its studies with a purely academic and social science perspective to eliminate political interference. She was critical of Taiwanese activists seeking out Indigenous participation to legitimize their own causes rather than having an understanding of the need to cooperate. She notes the lack of trust among Indigenous communities due to Taiwanese independence activists being opposed to ideas of Taiwanese Indigenous independence. She recalled facing criticism from her relatives for her social activism and opposition to nuclear development, having economically relied on the Taiwan Power Company and the roots of the Kuomintang within her community. Tuhi represented her community in protests against government regulation that denies Indigenous communities recourse in encroachment by private entities. She stressed the lack of free, prior and informed consent and allow for massive developments which split Indigenous peoples\\' lands.\\n\\nPolitical career\\nAhead of the 2020 Taiwanese legislative election, it was announced that Tuhi was to be given the top spot on the Democratic Progressive Party\\'s (DPP) party list. Tuhi had previously worked as a legislator\\'s assistant to a Kuomintang member of the Legislative Yuan. Her placement was theorized by New Bloom Magazine to be the result of the New Power Party\\'s choice of Kawlo Iyun Pacidal\\'s top position within their party list.\\n\\nHowever, when the party list was finalized, she was not given the spot as announced during a November 14 news conference. The DPP claimed that the removal was because of Tuhi\\'s lack of political experience, but it was believed by New Bloom Magazine that her removal was a result of factional deal making. Tuhi was believed to be the pick of Premier Su Tseng-chang. With the DPP removing younger candidates such as Tuhi in order to court older candidates who had left the party for the Formosa Alliance and the Taiwan Independence Action Party. She was additionally criticized for her previous work under a Kuomintang legislator and her work within Premier Su Tseng-chang\\'s Eball Foundation, as well as the spread of a claim that she was involved in a case of fraud.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nAmong the local Indigenous youth activist community she is called \"Sis\", overseas Indigenous activist peers refer to her as \"Jocelyn\", while Indigenous peers and relatives call her \"Jinumu\".\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nCategory:Living people\\nCategory:1985 births\\nCategory:Taiwanese activists\\nCategory:Puyuma people\\nCategory:21st-century Taiwanese women politicians\\nCategory:Indigenous rights activists\\nCategory:Taiwanese women activists\\nCategory:Taiwanese politicians of indigenous descent',\n",

       " 'The Albanian-Prilep War (Albanian:Lufta Shqiptaro-Prilep) was a conflict between the forces of the Muzaka family, a prominent Albanian noble family, and the Principality of Gropa on one side, against the Lordship of Prilep, a region under the control of the Mrnjavčević family. The conflict took place in the late 14th century during a period of political fragmentation in the Balkans, following the decline of the Serbian Empire.\\n\\n Background \\nOn December 4, 1371, the Serbian Empire dissolved and was divided between several feudal fragmentations, in particular one of them was the Lordship of Prilep in the modern territories of Albania, Macedonia, Kosovo and Greece, under the regime of King Marko this Lordship wanted to expand its territories towards the rest of the Balkans, trying to reform the old empire but they did not expect resistance from the neighboring principalities.\\n\\nCauses of the War\\nThe war was primarily caused by territorial disputes and the desire for control over strategic regions in central and southern Albania, as well as northern Macedonia. The Muzaka family, one of the most influential Albanian noble families, sought to expand their influence and consolidate their power in the region. The Principality of Gropa, a smaller but strategically located principality, allied with the Muzaka family to counter the growing influence of the Mrnjavčević family, who ruled the Lordship of Prilep.\\n\\nCourse of the War\\nThe conflict began in early 1371, with both sides mobilizing their forces. The Muzaka family, led by Andrea II Muzaka, coordinated their efforts with the Gropa family, led by  Andrea Gropa. The Albanian forces launched a series of raids into the territory controlled by the Lordship of Prilep, targeting key fortresses and supply routes.\\n\\nThe Lordship of Prilep, under the command of Marko Mrnjavčević, mounted a counteroffensive to repel the Albanian advance. Despite their efforts, the Prilep forces were unable to match the strategic coordination and determination of the enemies and most of the principality land got conquered.\\n\\nKey Battles\\nSeveral key battles took place during the war, with the most significant being the Battle of Savra. Although traditionally associated with the Battle of Maritsain which Vukašin Mrnjavčević met his end,the Muzaka family used the instability following this battle to secure a decisive victory in their conflict with Prilep.\\n\\nOutcome\\nThe Albanian-Prilep War ended with a decisive victory for the Albanian principalities. The Muzaka family succeeded in expanding their territory and solidifying their control over key regions in central and southern Albania. The Principality of Gropa also benefited from the victory, strengthening its position in the region and expanded their territory a little.\\n\\nThe defeat weakened the Lordship of Prilep, diminishing its influence in the Balkans and contributing to the gradual decline of Serbian dominance in the area. The victory of the Albanian forces set the stage for the rise of Albanian principalities and the eventual emergence of the League of Lezhë 73 years later, which would play a crucial role in resisting Ottoman expansion in the region.\\n\\nSee also\\n Muzaka family\\n History of Albania \\n Serbian empire \\n Andrea II Muzaka\\n King Marko\\n Lordship of Prilep\\n History of Serbia\\n Albanian Principalities\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nCategory:Wars involving Albania\\nCategory:14th century in Albania\\nCategory:1371 in Europe\\nCategory:Conflicts in 1371',\n",
